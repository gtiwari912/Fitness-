                The first thing that comes in our mind when we hear the word fitness is:- a great aesthetic body having a low body fat percentage and good muscularity. Well, it’s not as simple as that. Fitness is not just about physical looks and stuff, it’s way beyond that.\n\n
As success is the by-product of excellence, and money is the by-product of effort and skill, in the same way, a good physique is a by-product of many factors like strength, stamina, speed, endurance, mobility etc. And it’s not just physical fitness, but other types of fitness like mental, social, emotional and spiritual fitness are also equally important to stay strong, healthy and most importantly ‘happy’.\n\n
Fitness is broadly classified into 5 categories:-\n\n
a) Physical\n
 b) Mental\n
c) Social\n
d) Emotional\n
e) Spiritual\n\n

           <div id="2">
               Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate to vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest.\n\n

               <b><font size="20">Components of Physical Fitness</font></b>\n
Depending on the source, the components of fitness vary considerably. Below are common components:\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="4">
               •   <b>Cardiorespiratory endurance</b> - typically measured by how long or fast a person can perform an activity and how this impacts measurements such as heart rate and oxygen consumption.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="5">
               •   <b>Muscular endurance</b> - typically measured by how many repetitions of an exercise a person can perform. Common tests involve push-ups and sit ups.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="6">
               •   <b>Muscular strength</b> - typically measured by how much weight can be moved in relation to repetitions. Exercises involving multiple joints and muscle groups such as squats or bench press are often used.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="7">
               •   <b>Muscular power</b> - typically measured by how much force can be generated during a given activity. Advanced equipment used by bio-mechanists is often needed to measure muscular power.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="8">
               •   <b>Flexibility</b> - typically measured by how far a muscle group can be stretched or joint can be moved. The most common tests involve the hamstrings and shoulders.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="9">
               •   <b>Balance</b> - typically measured by how long a particular position can be held with or without some type of activity being performed. Simple tests such as standing on one leg can be used to assess balance. More advanced tests may involve standing on an unsteady object while trying to catch a ball.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="10">
               •   <b>Speed</b> - typically measured by how quickly an individual can move from one point to another. The 40-yard dash is often used to assess speed.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="11">
               •   <b>Body composition</b> - this is the amount of fat on the body versus other tissues such as muscle, bones and skin. Measured using a variety of tests and devices. Simple tests using mathematical equations or calipers are common and inexpensive. More advanced tests such as underwater weighing are far less common and much more expensive.\n\n

            </div>
            <div id="2">
                <b>What is it?</b>\n
Mental fitness refers to a state of psychosocial well-being, it means having a positive sense of how we feel, think, and act, which improves our ability to enjoy life. It contributes to our innate ability to be self-determined.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>What does it look like?</b>\n
A person who demonstrates high levels of mental fitness often has the following characteristics:\n\n
•  Knowledge of their strengths, limitation and interests\n\n
•  Creativity\n\n
•  Problem solving and conflict resolution\n\n
•  Accountable for their actions and decisions\n\n
•  Seek help when needed\n\n
•  Follow their ideas and actions in spite of difficulty or opposition\n\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="4">
                <b>Why does it matter?</b>\n
Mental fitness is fundamental to drive positive lifestyle changes and is also a strong predictor of physical health. Improved mental fitness motivates us for positive lifestyle changes around healthy eating, increased physical activity, and tobacco-free living.\n\n
In contrast, when the three basic psychological needs (competence, autonomy, and relatedness) are not met, individuals are at higher risk for experiencing difficulties related to their emotional, social, and physical wellness.\n\n
Research also tell us that people who experience higher levels of mental fitness live longer, are more successful in school and at work, are happier in their relationships, and are less prone to mental illnesses.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <b>What can you do?</b>\n
The opportunities to improve our mental fitness begin in our homes, schools, communities and workplaces! There are various things we can do to encourage an environment that improve mental fitness.\n\n
•  Organize activities that are conducive to generating people’s interest and engagement\n\n
•  Promote success\n\n
•  Give constructive feedback\n\n
•  Provide active listening\n\n
•  Take into account suggestions from others\n\n
•  Make expectations clear and give the significance and usefulness of, and the reason for, the task assigned\n\n
•  Give choices\n\n
•  Suggest rather than dictate\n\n
•  Reduce all coercive approaches\n\n
•  Welcome and take into account others’ ideas\n\n
•  Show empathy for others\n\n
•  Respect, accept, and take an interest in others\n\n
•  Be present and attentive (mindful) to others’ need for competence, autonomy and relatedness\n\n\n

Start with the following top superfoods for improved health and fitness:\n\n
                •  OATS (high in Fibre, improved digestion, heart health)\n\n
                •  BLUEBERRIES (antioxidants, reduces inflammation, cancer-fighting)\n\n
                •  APPLES (antioxidants, reduces inflammation, weight loss)\n\n
                •  GREEN TEA (antioxidants, increases metabolism, weight loss)\n\n
                •  FLAXSEEDS (essential fatty acids, increases metabolism, reduces inflammation)\n\n
                •  BROCCOLI (antioxidants, cancer-fighting, detox)\n\n
                •  YOGURT (calcium, probiotic, improved digestion, bone health)\n\n
                •  OLIVE OIL (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)/heart health)\n\n
                •  BEANS (high in Fibre, antioxidants, improved brain function)\n\n

            <div id="2">
                Just following a proper nutrition plan is not enough to stay physically fit. Expecting to build stamina, speed, endurance, strength, flexibility, mobility etc. simply through nutrition and without physical activity, is like expecting to drive an automobile or an aircraft using the ‘best engine fuels’ but WITHOUT AN ‘ENGINE’!\n\n
Physical activity simply means movement of the body that uses energy. For health benefits, physical activity should be moderate or vigorous intensity. Physical activity can take various forms which include sports (athletics, badminton, football, cricket, basketball, volleyball, lawn tennis, table tennis, hockey etc.), cardiovascular exercises (walking, jogging, sprinting etc.), resistance training (weight training, bodyweight training), skill training (calisthenics, gymnastics, plyometrics), flexibility and mobility training (yoga) etc.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>Types of physical activity:-</b>\n
The four main types of physical activity are aerobic, muscle-strengthening, bone-strengthening, and stretching.\n\n
Aerobic activity is the type that benefits your heart and lungs the most.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="4">
                <b>Aerobic Activity</b>\n
Aerobic activity moves your large muscles, such as those in your arms and legs. Running, swimming, walking, bicycling, dancing, and doing jumping jacks are examples of aerobic activity. Aerobic activity is also called endurance activity.\n\n
Aerobic activity makes your heart beat faster than usual. You also breathe harder during this type of activity. Over time, regular aerobic activity makes your heart and lungs stronger and able to work better.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <b>Other Types of Physical Activity</b>\n
The other types of physical activity are muscle-strengthening, bone strengthening, and stretching that benefit your body in other ways.\n\n
Muscle-strengthening activities improve the strength, power, and endurance of your muscles. Practising calisthenics (bodyweight exercises), lifting weights, climbing stairs, and digging in the garden are examples of muscle-strengthening activities.\n\n
With bone-strengthening activities, your feet, legs, or arms support your body\'s weight, and your muscles push against your bones. This helps make your bones strong. Running, walking, jumping rope, and lifting weights are examples of bone-strengthening activities.\n\n
Muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening activities also can be aerobic, depending on whether they make your heart and lungs work harder than usual. For example, running is both an aerobic activity and a bone-strengthening activity.\n\n
Stretching helps improve your flexibility and your ability to fully move your joints. Touching your toes, doing side stretches, and performing yoga exercises are examples of stretching.\n\n

            <div id="1"><font size="30"><b>Rest and Recovery (The Third Pillar)</b></font></div>\n\n\n
            <div id="2">
                Rest is physically necessary so that the muscles can repair, rebuild, and strengthen. For recreational athletes, building in rest days can help maintain a better balance between home, work, and fitness goals.\n\n
In the worst-case scenario, too few rest and recovery days can lead to \'overtraining syndrome\', a difficult condition to recover from.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>What Happens During Recovery?</b>\n
Building recovery time into any training program is important because this is the time that the body adapts to the stress of exercise and the real training effect takes place. Recovery also allows the body to replenish energy stores and repair damaged tissues. Exercise or any other physical work causes changes in the body such as muscle tissue breakdown and the depletion of energy stores (muscle glycogen) as well as fluid loss.\n\n
Recovery time allows these stores to be replenished and allows tissue repair to occur. Without sufficient time to repair and replenish, the body will continue to breakdown from intensive exercise.\n\n
Symptoms of overtraining often occur from a lack of recovery time. Signs of overtraining include a feeling of general malaise, staleness, depression, decreased sports performance, and increased risk of injury, among others.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="4">
                <b>Short and Long-Term Recovery</b>\n
Keep in mind that there are 2 categories of recovery. There is immediate (short-term) recovery from a particularly intense training session or event, and there is the long-term recovery that needs to be built into a year-round training schedule. Both are important for optimal sports performance.\n\n

                \'Short-term recovery\', sometimes called active recovery occurs in the hours immediately after an intense exercise. Active recovery refers to engaging in low-intensity exercise after workouts during both the cool-down phase immediately after a hard effort or workout as well as during the days following the workout. Both types of active recovery are linked to performance benefits.\n\n
Another major focus of recovery immediately following exercise has to do with replenishing energy stores and fluids lost during exercise and optimizing protein synthesis (the process of increasing the protein content of muscle cells, preventing muscle breakdown, and increasing muscle size) by eating the right foods in the post-exercise meal.\n\n
This is also the time for soft tissue (muscles, tendons, ligaments) repair and the removal of chemicals that build up as a result of cell activity during exercise.\n\n
Getting quality sleep is also an important part of short-term recovery. Make sure to get plenty of sleep, (at least 7-8 hours daily) especially if you are doing hard training.\n\n

                \'Long-term recovery\' techniques refer to those that are built into a seasonal training program. Most well-designed training schedules will include recovery days or weeks that are built into an annual training schedule. This is also the reason why athletes and coaches change their training program throughout the year, add cross-training, modify workouts types, and make changes in intensity, time, distance, and all the other training variables.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <b>Adaptation to Exercise</b>\n
The \'Principle of Adaptation\' states that when we undergo the stress of physical exercise, our body adapts and becomes more efficient. It’s just like learning any new skill; at first, it’s difficult, but over time it becomes second-nature. Once you adapt to a given stress, you require additional stress to continue to make progress.\n\n
There are limits to how much stress the body can tolerate before it breaks down and risks injury. Doing too much work too quickly will result in injury or muscle damage, but doing too little, too slowly will not result in any improvement. This is why personal trainers set up specific training programs that increase time and intensity at a planned rate and allow rest days throughout the program.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="6">
                <b>Sleep Deprivation Can Hinder Sports Performance</b>\n
                In general, one or two nights of poor or little sleep won\'t have much impact on performance, but consistently getting inadequate sleep can result in subtle changes in hormone levels, particularly those related to stress, muscle recovery, and mood. While no one completely understands the complexities of sleep, research published in 2015 indicates that sleep deprivation can lead to increased levels of \'cortisol\' (a stress hormone), decreased the activity of \'human growth hormone\' (which is active during tissue repair), and decreased \'glycogen synthesis\'.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="7">
                <b>Balance Exercise with Rest and Recovery</b>\n
It is this alternation of adaptation and recovery that takes the athlete to a higher level of fitness. High-level athletes need to realize that the greater the training intensity and effort, the greater the need for planned recovery. Monitoring your workouts with a training log, and paying attention to how your body feels and how motivated you are is extremely helpful in determining your recovery needs and modifying your training program accordingly.\n\n

                \n All foods contain differing combinations of amino acids. In general, animal proteins like meat, dairy, and eggs contain all the essential amino acids.\n\n
Plant-based proteins from foods like beans, grains, nuts, and soy are rich in some amino acids but may lack others. A well-balanced diet with a variety of foods can provide sufficient protein for the body\'s needs.\n\n

•  lack of growth\n\n
•  loss of muscle mass\n\n
•  reduced immunity\n\n
•  weakening of the heart\n\n
•  respiratory problems\n\n\n
Protein deficiency can be fatal. Some people develop ‘kwashiorkor’ as a result of protein deficiency. It is a type of malnutrition, and it’s common during a famine.\n\n
Early signs include swelling in the legs and possibly the face, due to ‘Edema’, or fluid collecting under the skin. Other symptoms are a pot belly, fatigue, dry brittle hair, and cracked nails. The person will be more prone to infections.\n\n
In developed countries, those most at risk of a protein deficiency include people who do not eat properly, for example, due to a poorly managed weight loss diet, an eating disorder, or inability to cook their own food, for example, in older age.\n\n

                <b>Demerits of excess protein intake</b>\n
Most studies support an intake of up to 2 g per kg of body weight without any negative or adverse effects.\n\n
Consuming more than 2.5 g of protein per kg of body weight (for example, over 225g protein for a person weighing 200 pounds) can increase the risk of:\n
•  dehydration\n
•  fatigue\n
•  fat gain\n
•  constipation\n
•  passing out more calcium in the urine\n\n
Eating more than 200 to 400 g of protein a day can make it hard for the liver to convert excess nitrogen to a waste product called urea. This can lead to nausea, diarrhoea, and other adverse side effects.\n\n
Some experts have warned that with the current craze for high-protein diets, including protein shakes, people may be consuming more protein than is healthy.\n\n
While protein supplements can assist those who have high protein needs reach their goals, it is usually best for most of the protein to come from a well-balanced diet of whole foods.\n\n

Majority of peanut butter jars, packets and bottles are bought from the shopping malls and grocery markets. The problem with this is that most of the peanut butter brands that are found in shopping malls and grocery stores are NOT natural peanut butter sources, but are rather processed.\n\n"
The only ingredient that is used to prepare natural peanut butter is roasted peanuts. That’s it! But almost all the peanut butter brands found in the markets usually contain many more ingredients like added salt, sweeteners, artificial preservatives, stabilisers, emulsifiers and most dangerous among them all being partially hydrogenated oils, which prevents the oil from the peanut butter to separate and rise to the top. Partially hydrogenated oils are VERY BAD FOR OUR HEART HEALTH as they increase our LDL (bad cholesterol) levels and reduce HDL (good cholesterol) levels, which can eventually lead to heart diseases.\n\n
With that being said, the peanut butter (processed) that you consume on a daily basis in the name of ‘good health’, is actually ‘ruining’ yours! It’s best to THROW AWAY those peanut butter brands that contain ingredients other than ‘roasted peanuts’ and STOP BUYING THEM in the future.\n\n
Instead, buy the brands that contain ‘natural’ peanut butter containing only ‘roasted peanuts’ in their ingredient list. An easy way to distinguish between ‘natural’ and ‘processed’ ones is simple. ‘Processed’ ones are usually ‘solid’ at room temperature, whereas ‘natural’ ones are ‘thick liquids’ at room temperature.\n\n

                \n\n<b>Unsaturated fats</b>\n
Unsaturated fats, which are liquid at room temperature, are considered beneficial fats because they can improve blood cholesterol levels, ease inflammation, stabilize heart rhythms, and play a number of other beneficial roles. Unsaturated fats are predominantly found in foods from plants, such as vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds.\n\n
There are two types of ‘good’ unsaturated fats:\n\n
1. \'MONOUNSATURATED FATS\' are found in high concentrations in:\n\n
o  Olive, peanut, and canola oils\n\n
o  Avocados\n\n
o  Nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and pecans\n\n
o  Seeds such as pumpkin and sesame seeds\n\n\n
2. \'POLYUNSATURATED FATS\' are found in high concentrations in:\n\n
o  Sunflower, corn, soybean, and flaxseed oils\n\n
o  Walnuts\n\n
o  Flax seeds\n\n
o  Fish\n\n
o  Canola oil – though higher in monounsaturated fat, it’s also a good source of polyunsaturated fat.\n\n\n
Omega-3 fats are an important type of polyunsaturated fat. The body can’t make these, so they must come from food.\n\n
•  An excellent way to get omega-3 fats is by eating fish 2-3 times a week.\n\n
•  Good plant sources of omega-3 fats include flax seeds, walnuts, and canola or soybean oil.\n\n
•  Higher blood omega-3 fats are associated with lower risk of premature death among older adults, according to a study by HSPH faculty.\n\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="2">
                <b>Saturated Fats</b>\n
All foods containing fat have a mix of specific types of fats. Even healthy foods like chicken and nuts have small amounts of saturated fat, though much less than the amounts found in beef, cheese, and ice cream. Saturated fat is mainly found in animal foods, but a few plant foods are also high in saturated fats, such as coconut, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil.\n\n
The sources of saturated fat are:\n\n
•  Pizza and cheese\n\n
•  Whole and reduced fat milk, butter and dairy desserts\n\n
•  Meat products (sausage, bacon, beef, hamburgers)\n\n
•  Cookies and other grain-based desserts\n\n
•  A variety of mixed fast food dishes\n\n
Though decades of dietary advice suggested saturated fat was harmful, in recent years that idea has begun to evolve. Several studies suggest that eating diets high in saturated fat do not raise the risk of heart disease, with one report analysing the findings of 21 studies that followed 350,000 people for up to 23 years.\n\n
Investigators looked at the relationship between saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Their controversial conclusion: “There is INSUFFICIENT evidence from prospective epidemiologic studies to conclude that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD.”\n\n
The overarching message is that cutting back on saturated fat can be good for health if people replace saturated fat with good fats, especially, polyunsaturated fats. Eating good fats in place of saturated fat lowers the “bad” LDL cholesterol, and it improves the ratio of total cholesterol to “good” HDL cholesterol, lowering the risk of heart disease.\n\n
Eating good fats in place of saturated fat can also help prevent insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes. So while saturated fat may not be as harmful as once thought, evidence clearly shows that unsaturated fat remains the healthiest type of fat.\n\n

            <b>Trans Fats</b>\n
Trans fatty acids, more commonly called trans fats, are made by heating liquid vegetable oils in the presence of hydrogen gas and a catalyst, a process called hydrogenation.\n\n
•  Partially hydrogenating vegetable oils makes them more stable and less likely to become rancid. This process also converts the oil into a solid, which makes them function as margarine or shortening.\n\n
•  Partially hydrogenated oils can withstand repeated heating without breaking down, making them ideal for frying fast foods.\n\n
•  For these reasons, partially hydrogenated oils became a mainstay in restaurants and the food industry – for frying, baked goods, and processed snack foods and margarine.\n\n\n
Partially hydrogenated oil is not the only source of trans fats in our diets. Trans fats are also naturally found in beef fat and dairy fat in small amounts.\n\n
Trans fats are the worst type of fat for the heart, blood vessels, and rest of the body because they:\n\n
•  Raise bad LDL and lower good HDL\n\n
•  Create inflammation – a reaction related to immunity – which has been implicated in heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic conditions\n\n
•  Contribute to insulin resistance\n\n
•  Can have harmful health effects even in small amounts – for each additional 2% of Calories from trans fat consumed daily, the risk of coronary heart disease increases by 23%.\n\n\n

                <b>BOTTOM LINE:-</b>\n
                So, this brings us to a conclusion that the majority of our fat intake must come from UNSATURATED FATS. But this doesn’t give us the license to include as much fat in our nutrition as possible. Remember fats are calorie dense (9 kcal/g). So overconsumption of fat will simply lead to an overall calorie surplus, which will eventually get stored as body fat, which we obviously don’t want.\n\n
                So always CONSUME FATS IN MODERATION.\n

            <div id="2">
                Dietary Fibre, also known as roughage or bulk, includes the parts of plant foods your body can\'t digest or absorb. Unlike other food components, such as fats, proteins or carbohydrates, which your body breaks down and absorbs, fibre isn\'t digested by your body. Instead, it passes relatively intact through your stomach, small intestine and colon and out of your body.\n\n
Fibre is commonly classified as soluble, which dissolves in water, or insoluble, which doesn\'t dissolve.\n\n
•  SOLUBLE FIBRE:- This type of fibre dissolves in water to form a gel-like material. It can help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels. Soluble Fibre is found in oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium.\n\n
•  INSOLUBLE FIBRE:- This type of fibre promotes the movement of material through your digestive system and increases stool bulk, so it can be of benefit to those who struggle with constipation or irregular stools. Whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, beans and vegetables, such as cauliflower, green beans and potatoes, are good sources of insoluble Fibre.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>Benefits of fibre:-</b>\n\n
•  Normalises bowel movement\n\n
•  Helps maintain bowel health\n\n
•  Lowers cholesterol levels\n\n
•  Helps control blood sugar levels\n\n
•  Aids in achieving healthy weight\n\n
•  Helps you live longer\n\n\n
If you aren\'t getting enough fibre each day, you may need to boost your intake. Good choices include:\n\n
•  Whole-grain products\n\n
•  Fruits\n\n
•  Vegetables\n\n
•  Beans, peas and other legumes\n\n
•  Nuts and seeds\n\n\n
Refined or processed foods such as canned fruits and vegetables, pulp-free juices, white breads and pastas, and non-whole-grain cereals are lower in fibre. The grain-refining process removes the outer coat (bran) from the grain, which lowers its fibre content. Enriched foods have some of the B vitamins and iron added back after processing, but not the fibre.\n\n

            <div id="2">
                It’s common to hear that water is essential for your health. But why?\n\n
This substance makes up a majority of your body weight and is involved in many important functions, including:\n\n
•  flushing out waste from your body\n\n
•  regulating body temperature\n\n
•  helping your brain function\n\n
You get most of your water from drinking beverages, but food also contributes a small amount to your daily water intake.\n\n
The 16 reasons why you need to consume water:-\n\n
•  It helps create saliva\n\n
•  It regulates your body temperature\n\n
•  It protects your tissues, spinal cord, and joints\n\n
•  It helps excrete waste through perspiration, urination, and defecation\n\n
•  It helps maximize physical performance\n\n
•  It helps prevent constipation\n\n
•  It aids in digestion\n\n
•  It helps with nutrient absorption\n\n
•  It helps you lose weight\n\n
•  It improves blood oxygen circulation\n\n
•  It helps fight off illness\n\n
•  It helps boost energy\n\n
•  It aids in cognitive function\n\n
•  It helps improve mood\n\n
•  It helps keep skin bright\n\n
•  It prevents overall dehydration\n\n\n

            <div id="3">
<b>How much should you drink?</b>\n
Being attentive to the amount of water you drink each day is important for optimal health. Most people drink when they’re thirsty, which helps regulate daily water intake.\n\n
According to the ‘National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’, general water intake (from all beverages and foods) that meet most people’s needs are:\n\n
•  About 15.5 cups of water (125 ounces) each day for men\n\n
•  About 11.5 cups (91 ounces) daily for women\n\n
People get about 20% of their daily water intake from food. The rest is dependent on drinking water and water-based beverages. So, ideally men would consume about 100 ounces (3.0 litres) of water from beverages, and women, about 73 ounces (2.12 litres) from beverages.\n\n
You’ll have to increase your water intake if you’re exercising or living in a hotter region to avoid dehydration.\n\n
Other ways to assess hydration include your thirst and the colour of your urine. Feeling thirsty indicates your body is not receiving adequate hydration. Urine that is dark or coloured indicates dehydration. Pale or non-coloured urine typically indicates proper hydration.\n\n

<b>Ways to Prevent Over-hydration or Water Intoxication</b>\n

Here are a few ways you can stop drinking too much water:\n\n
•  If you have medical conditions like diabetes or kidney problems, talk to your doctor to find out how much water you should consume.\n\n
•  If you exercise regularly, you may drink 2-4 cups of water per hour while exercising. If you need more water, drink sports drinks as they contain electrolytes that help balance the salts in your body.\n\n
•  Endurance athletes should measure their weight before and after a race to determine how much water they lost from the body. The lost water can be replenished without running the risk of over-hydration.\n\n

For example vitamin C is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals that make enough internally.\n\n

•  Vitamins are nutrients that our body needs to function and fight off disease. Our body cannot produce vitamins itself. So we must get them through food that we eat or in some cases, supplements.\n\n


•  There are 13 vitamins that are essential for the proper functioning of our body.\n\n
•  There are two types of vitamins:- \'fat-soluble\' and \'water-soluble\'. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in your fat cells, consequently requiring fat in order to be absorbed. Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in your body; therefore, they need to be replenished daily. Your body takes what it needs from the food you eat and excretes what is not needed as waste.\n\n\n

            <div id="2">
                The exact biochemistry behind fat loss is a bit complicated and beyond the scope of this app. But I will try my best to explain the basic concept behind it.\n\n

According to the ‘First Law of Thermodynamics’ or the ‘Law of Conservation of Energy’, energy is neither created nor destroyed,  rather it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to the other.\n\n
This concept applies to both weight loss and weight gain in all organisms.\n\n
Any organism requires a certain amount of energy depending on its size, to carry out various biochemical and physical processes occurring both inside and outside its body in order to survive and maintain its weight.\n\n
                This energy is obtained from the food that the organism consumes. If the amount of energy obtained from the food consumed by that organism is equal to the total energy required to survive and carry out physical activities, then the weight of the organism will remain unchanged and this quantity of energy is termed as <b>Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) or maintenance Calories</b>.\n\n
                </div>
                <div id="3">
                    If the energy from the food consumed is higher than this ‘TDEE’, then the  organism will gain weight as the excess energy or Calories from food will be transformed to mass in the form of new body cells (don’t confuse this with Einstein’s famous mass-energy equivalence relation or E = mc<sup><font size="10">2</font></sup>,
                </div>
                <div id="3.1">
                    this is just a rough explanation). These new cells contribute to \'weight gain\' of the organism. This weight gain can either be in the form of fat cells, muscle cells, water retention, or in some cases an increase in <i>BMD (Bone Mineral Density)</i>.
                </div>
                <div id="4">
                    This process is known as <b>anabolism or constructive metabolism</b>.
                </div>
                <div id="5">
                    This excess energy is termed as <b>calorie surplus</b>.\n\n
                </div>
                <div id="6">
                Conversely, the organism will lose weight due to the energy consumption being less than the TDEE. This process is known as <b>catabolism or destructive metabolism</b>.
                </div>
                <div id="7">
                This deficit in energy is termed as <b>calorie deficit</b>.\n\n

Now obviously this theory applies to human beings as well!\n\n

Before covering the of topic fat loss, let’s just clear the difference between \'fat loss\' and \'weight loss\'.\n\n\n

            <div id="10">
Loss of bone mass due to reduction in BMD occurs only when exercising is completely ignored and proper nutrition (Calcium and Vitamin D intake) is also neglected. Loss of BMD usually occurs in extreme weight losses.\n\n

\n\nYou definitely might have seen, read and heard tons of ways to lose fat on the internet and lifestyle magazines. For example:- “Lose 10 pounds in 1 week!”, “Lose 2 kg in 1 day!”, “1 trick to lose 2 pounds of belly fat overnight!”, “flat stomach hacks”, “magical detox diets”, “lemon juice diet”, “apple diet”, “burn fat with apple cider vinegar”, “egg diet”, “fat burners”, “body wraps!”, and the list is endless!\n\n
                                                         If it was so easy to lose fat, then why is obesity a huge problem in the world?! Why don’t we see everyone in the streets with jacked physiques? Why does our “New Year’s resolution” always fail? The simple answer to this is that the above stated “shortcuts” are just \'marketing gimmicks\' that are completely BULSH***ING YOU! There is unfortunately no secret or shortcut for achieving a good physique. Nothing in life worth having comes easy!\n\n
                             It requires a BURNING DESIRE, dedication, determination, DISCIPLINE, hard work, PATIENCE, perseverance, and last but not the least, CONSISTENCY. CONSISTENCY is always the key!\n\n
                The only way to stay consistent is not through continuous motivation, but by ENJOYING the \'process\' and not focussing on the \'results\'. And the only way to enjoy the process is to stay in MODERATION. Going the \'extreme way\' and aiming for \'perfection\' is only going to waste your time, energy and money! (Like I did)\n\n
                         Fitness is not a goal, it’s a lifestyle. It’s a marathon, not a 100 m race! How can you expect to reach the finishing line of a marathon in optimum time by \'sprinting\' from the beginning? You have to take steady, moderate and consistent steps to reach the finishing line in the best time possible. The same applies here too.\n\n
                                       I sincerely apologise for my endless advices and detailed info, but my motive behind this is to change the ATTITUDE of the society towards fitness, as ATTITUDE CHANGES EVERYTHING. Based on my 3 years of experience (Starting from Dec 2016), I have learnt that fitness is an extremely complicated discipline and having a \'stereotypical mindset\' and a \'dogmatic approach\' towards it (the mindset I used to have) is only going to waste your time, energy and money (like I did).\n\n
                   Given below are some images that depict the \'truth\', and the \'correct\' ways of losing fat:-\n

A \'moderate calorie deficit\' of \'300- 500 Calories per day\' is optimal for fat loss. A deficit of more than 500 Calories (extreme calorie deficit) can result in weight loss, and you know what weight loss is. In addition to that, extreme calorie deficit can cause various problems like:-\n\n

                •  <b>Binge eating disorder</b>\n\n
Honestly, I did suffer with binge eating disorder during the 5th semester of my B.Tech due to severely dropping my daily caloric intake. I always had this mentality that the higher the calorie deficit, the faster I will reach my dream physique. When our body experiences extremely low caloric intake, it goes into the ‘survival mode’. In this mode, our body solely focuses on getting as many Calories as possible in order to survive, which eventually forces us to eat high Calorie fatty foods (the so called ‘forbidden’ foods) in UNBELIEVABLE quantities. This eventually made me end up in a ‘binge eating cycle’.\n\n

This was undoubtedly the WORST phase of my fitness journey as it literally stabbed me from the inside due to guilt and made me feel extremely lonely and isolated. And the problem with binge eating is that it’s a \'vicious cycle\' that never stops. What I mean by that is when someone ends a binge, he/she starts feeling extremely guilty about it and ends up restricting his/her Calories drastically again the next day to ‘compensate’ for the binge. But after a day or so after restriction, his/her body again enters the ‘survival mode’ and forces him/her to somehow binge again. And the cycle goes on and on.\n\n

         In order to attain a \'moderate deficit\', we must know the approximate value of our TDEE. You can get access to many online maintenance calorie calculators through the internet. But these aren’t accurate as these calculators just utilise your age, gender, height and weight, and activity level to calculate your TDEE. But important factors like \'BODY FAT PERCENTAGE\' and \'LEAN MUSCLE MASS\' that have a huge influence on our BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) aren’t included in these calculators.\n\n
                                  So some of the steps that I would recommend to find your TDEE are:-\n\n
1. Wake up in the morning, do your bowel movements, and without eating anything, check your weight using a digital weighing machine.\n\n
2. Consume the amount of Calories (TDEE) shown in the calculator for a day and don’t do any intense exercises on that day.\n\n
3. Repeat STEP 1, the next day.\n\n
4. If your weight remained the SAME, then the value in the calculator is almost accurate.\n\n
5. If your weight DECREASED slightly, then your actual TDEE might be 100- 200 Calories ABOVE the calculator value.\n\n
6.  If your weight INCREASED slightly, then your actual TDEE might be 100- 200 Calories BELOW the calculator value.\n\n\n

I know that maintaining a track of Calories consumed can be annoying and tedious at the beginning, but eventually after 1 or 2 weeks, you will be able to count your Calories just by looking at the stuff you are eating.\n\n

            <div id="2">
Muscle hypertrophy too has an extremely complicated biochemistry behind it, which is way beyond the scope of this app. But I will try my best to explain it in the simplest way possible.\n\n

Muscles provide the driving force for all movements in our body like lifting, pulling, pushing, running, walking, pumping blood from heart, organ functions etc.\n\n
There are 3 major types of muscles in the human muscular system:-\n\n
•  CARDIAC muscles, which are responsible for the function of our heart.\n\n
•  SMOOTH muscles, which are responsible for the function of our all other internal organs.\n\n
•  SKELETAL muscles, which are responsible for the movement of our bones.\n\n\n
Cardiac and smooth muscles function involuntarily, i.e. they operate by themselves, unlike skeletal muscles, that function voluntarily (they are under our conscious control).\n\n
                Cardiac and smooth muscle growth is obviously not in our hands, so we are left with \'skeletal muscles\', the muscles that are visible outside our body through our skin. <u>So, fitness is concerned about skeletal muscle hypertrophy only</u>.\n
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                \nSkeletal muscles contain approximately 75% water, 20% protein, 1–10% fat, and 1% glycogen.\n\n

The 4 MANDATORY and EQUALLY IMPORTANT conditions for muscle gain (muscle hypertrophy) are:-\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="4">
                •  <b>Intense resistance training</b>\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                •  <b>Adequate protein intake</b> (1.6 – 2.0 g / kg of body weight) to remain in a POSITIVE NITROGEN BALANCE.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="6">
•   <b>Staying close to TDEE</b> by adequate intake of other macro and micro nutrients, in order to prevent the breakdown of protein for energy (a slight calorie deficit or a slight calorie surplus, usually 100-300 Calories).\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="7">
                •  <b>Adequate rest</b> (7-9 hours daily)\n\n\n
Failure to meet even one of the above conditions will NOT lead to muscle hypertrophy! PERIOD!\n\n
So, why are the above stated conditions EQUALLY important? Let me explain.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="8">
                When we carry out intense resistance training, many micro tears are formed in our muscle fibres. The repair of these micro tears is primarily carried out by protein and quality nutrition. New muscle fibres are produced to help replace and repair the damaged ones. This particular process is termed as <b>Muscle Protein Synthesis or MPS</b>
            </div>
            <div id="9">
                (as muscle fibres are made of protein). More fibres are produced to make up for the damaged ones, and this is where the actual muscle growth takes place. MPS occurs VERY SLOWLY when we are awake. However, the speed of this process is SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATED when we are ASLEEP. This is due to the fact that our body releases large amounts of \'anabolic muscle building hormones\' like <b>testosterone</b> and
            </div>
            <div id="10">
                <b>IGF-1</b> (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1) during our
            </div>
            <div id="11">
                <b>REM (Rapid Eye Movement)</b> sleep.\n\n
So, the combination of all the above activities eventually leads to muscle hypertrophy. MPS lasts for about 24-48 hours after our resistance training session.\n\n
As every repair process leads to the production of new muscle fibres and not muscle tissues, this muscle gain process is EXTREMELY SLOW. It takes months to see noticeable fat loss, but it takes YEARS to see noticeable muscle gains! So, PATIENCE is the key here.\n\n
There is a difference between \'muscle gain\' and \'weight gain\'.\n\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="12">
                <i><b>MUSCLE GAIN</b>   =   increase in muscle mass (if the above conditions are met)</i>\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="13">
                <i><b>WEIGHT GAIN</b>   =   increase in muscle mass (if the above conditions are met) + fat gain + water retention</i>\n\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="14">
Weight gain necessarily occurs due to a \'calorie surplus\', but the same isn’t true for muscle gain. The fat gain and water retention occurs due to a \'high calorie surplus\'.\n\n

Also weight gain doesn’t necessarily mean muscle gain. The entire calorie surplus can be stored in the form of fat or water retention if the above muscle building conditions are not met.\n\n

The storage of the excess Calories in our body in the form of fat, is our body’s way of storing energy for future use. This stored energy is utilised when our body doesn’t get the required energy to survive and carry our physical activities (TDEE).  This occurs only when we are in a \'SLIGHT to MODERATE calorie deficit\' (100-500 Calories). This process eventually leads to fat loss.\n\n

In the case of \'extreme calorie deficit\' (greater than 500 Calories), our body starts tapping energy from both fats as well as muscles, which leads to <b>muscle loss (muscle atrophy)</b> as well, which is a part of weight loss.\n\n

                The muscles in our body are METABOLICALLY ACTIVE tissues. This means that our body requires energy just to carry the muscle mass we have. Our body requires a decent amount of protein from nutrition for maintaining muscle mass. But this isn’t enough. The primary use of muscles in our body is to carry out physical activity of a particular intensity. If we just consume protein and don’t carry out intense physical activities like resistance training, there would probably be no reason for our body to maintain muscle mass. So our body chooses the path of losing the muscle mass. This process is termed as
            </div>
            <div id="15">
                <b>muscle atrophy or muscle protein breakdown (MPD)</b>.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="16">
                <i>So, you ‘either use it, or lose it!’</i>\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="17">
                Other important factors that lead to muscle atrophy are <b>insufficient rest</b>
            </div>
            <div id="18">
                (less than 7 hours per day) and <b>overtraining</b>. Insufficient rest at night and overtraining leads to elevated levels of \'CORTISOL\', the \'stress hormone\' responsible for MPD.\n\n

Some of the benefits of muscle gain are:-\n\n
•  Increase in BMD which leads to reduced risk of fractures\n\n
•  Increase in BMR which promotes fat loss\n\n
•  Increase in testosterone levels\n\n
•  Increased energy levels\n\n
•  Drastic improvements in confidence and self esteem\n\n
•  Improvement in body aesthetics\n\n\n

Resistance training to increase muscle mass can be done with free weights, gym machines, resistance bands or even bodyweight exercises. How much muscle mass you\'ll gain depends on a number of factors, including your genetics, training regimen, nutrition and hormone levels. Some people can gain muscle much faster than others because of their genes. Men typically have more mass than women due to \'higher\' levels of \'testosterone\'.\n\n

It\'s important to develop an exercise routine that \'challenges\' your muscles. If you always do the same exercises with the same resistance, your body will adapt and you will stop seeing gains in muscle mass and strength.\n\n

Furthermore, your body needs to be properly nourished and hydrated to repair damaged muscle fibres after exercise and reap the benefits of weight training. You will see faster gains with a quality nutrition plan that provides plenty of protein and nutrients, and last but not the least, adequate rest of about 7-9 hours daily.\n\n

            <div id="2">
                Recreational drugs affect your body\'s central nervous system. They affect how you think, feel and behave. The three main types are depressants, hallucinogens and stimulants:\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                •  <b>DEPRESSANTS</b> slow or \'depress\' the function of the central nervous system. They slow the messages going to and from your brain. In small quantities depressants can cause a person to feel relaxed and less inhibited. In large amounts they may cause vomiting, unconsciousness and death. Depressants affect your concentration and coordination, and slow your ability to respond to situations. It is important to not operate heavy machinery while taking depressants.

This can cause increased heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature, reduced appetite, agitation and sleeplessness. In large amounts stimulants may cause anxiety, panic, seizures, stomach cramps and paranoia.

            </div>
            <div id="12">
<b>BREATHING</b>\n
Depressant drugs such as cannabis, alcohol and opiates, slow down your breathing. Cannabis reduces your lung capacity, so it’s harder to get the oxygen your muscles need during sport. Opiates, such as heroin and codeine, slow down your breathing and narrow your airways. This makes it harder to breathe and reduces your breathing at a time when your body needs extra oxygen.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="13">
                <b>HEART RATE</b>\n
Stimulant drugs, such as cocaine, ecstasy and speed, increase your heart rate and put undue stress on your heart. Cocaine can cause heart attack and abnormal heart rhythm. When you use speed, the lack of blood to your heart can cause angina (severe chest pain). Depressants such as alcohol slow down your heart rate, meaning less oxygen-rich blood reaches your muscles.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="14">
                <b>MUSCLES</b>\n
The last thing you want during sport is to disrupt your coordination and relax your muscles. Depressants such as cannabis reduce your motor activity so it’s hard to coordinate your movements during sport. Alcohol is high in Calories so you may start piling on the weight. Stimulants increase your movements so you are more likely to injure yourself during sport. Cocaine at higher doses can act as an anaesthetic so you can’t feel pain and may play on after an injury, causing even more damage.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="15">
                <b>CONCENTRATION</b>\n
Depressants like cannabis, alcohol and opiates affect your alertness and concentration, so you are slower to react. Stimulants, such as cocaine, speed and ecstasy can make you irritable and restless – making you less focused on the game.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="16">
                <b>SENSES</b>\n
Hallucinogens like cannabis and magic mushrooms can play havoc with your senses. They affect your sights and sounds, which could disrupt your performance.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="17">
                <b>PAIN</b>\n
Some depressants, such as alcohol, cause mild anaesthesia or loss of feeling, so you may not notice when you’re injured. This can lead to delays in getting rapid treatment and in recovery.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="18">
                <b>BRAIN and BEHAVIOUR</b>\n
Stimulants, such as cocaine and speed, can keep you awake so you don’t get the rest you need and this can affect your performance. They also decrease your appetite when you should be replacing Calories after using so much energy. Side effects also include confusion, delirium and paranoia. At higher doses stimulants can cause you to become irritable and aggressive, they can also cause blood vessels in the brain to rupture leading to convulsions.\n\n

                Most serious athletes will tell you that the drive to win is fierce. Besides the satisfaction of personal accomplishment, athletes often pursue dreams of winning a medal for their country or securing a spot on a professional team. In such an environment, the use of performance-enhancing drugs has become increasingly common.\n\n
                But using performance-enhancing drugs (doping) has risks. Take the time to learn about the potential benefits, the health risks and the many unknowns regarding so-called performance-enhancing drugs such as <b>anabolic steroids, androstenedione, human growth hormone, erythropoietin, diuretics, creatine and stimulants</b>. You may decide that the benefits aren\'t worth the risks.\n\n

            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>What are they?</b>\n
Some athletes take a form of steroids known as anabolic-androgenic steroids or just anabolic steroids to increase their muscle mass and strength. The main anabolic steroid hormone produced by your body is testosterone.\n\n
Testosterone has two main effects on your body:\n\n
•	Anabolic effects promote muscle building.\n\n
•	Androgenic effects are responsible for male traits, such as facial hair and a deeper voice.\n\n\n
Some athletes take straight testosterone to boost their performance. The anabolic steroids used by athletes are often synthetic modifications of testosterone.\n\n
These hormones have approved medical uses. But improving athletic performance isn\'t one of them.\n\n
Why are these drugs so appealing to athletes? Besides making muscles bigger, anabolic steroids may reduce the muscle damage that occurs during a hard workout, helping athletes recover from the session more quickly and enabling them to work out harder and more frequently. Some athletes, as well as non-athletes, may like the muscular appearance they get when they take the drugs.\n\n

                <b>What is it?</b>\n
Androstenedione (andro) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, ovaries and testes. It\'s a hormone that\'s normally converted to testosterone and a form of estrogen (estradiol) in both men and women.\n\n
Andro is available legally only by prescription and is a controlled substance. Its use as a performance-enhancing drug is illegal.\n\n
Manufacturers and bodybuilding magazines tout andro\'s ability to allow athletes to train harder and recover more quickly. Scientific studies that refute these claims show that supplemental androstenedione doesn’t increase testosterone and that your muscles don\'t get stronger with andro use.\n\n
            </div>

Erythropoietin is a type of hormone used to treat anaemia in people with severe kidney disease. It increases production of red blood cells and haemoglobin — the protein that carries oxygen to your body\'s organs.\n\n
Taking erythropoietin improves the movement of oxygen to the muscles. \'Epoetin\', a synthetic form of erythropoietin, is commonly used by endurance athletes.\n\n

            <div id="23">
                <b>What is it?</b>\n
Many athletes take nutritional supplements instead of or in addition to performance-enhancing drugs. Supplements are available over-the-counter as powders or pills. Creatine monohydrate is a supplement that\'s popular among athletes.\n\n
Creatine is a naturally occurring compound produced by your body that helps your muscles release energy. Scientific research indicates that creatine may have some athletic benefit by producing small gains in short-term bursts of power.\n\n
Creatine appears to help muscles make more Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which stores and transports energy in cells, and is used for quick bursts of activity, such as weightlifting or sprinting. But there\'s no evidence that creatine enhances performance in aerobic or endurance sports.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="24">
                <b>Risks</b>\n
Possible side effects of creatine that can decrease athletic performance include:\n\n
•	Stomach cramps\n\n
•	Muscle cramps\n\n
•	Weight gain\n\n\n
Weight gain is sought by athletes who want to increase their size. But with prolonged creatine use, weight gain is more likely the result of water retention than an increase in muscle mass. Water is drawn into your muscle tissue, away from other parts of your body, putting you at risk of dehydration.\n\n
It appears safe for adults to use creatine at the doses recommended by manufacturers. But there are no studies investigating the long-term benefits and risks of creatine supplementation.\n\n

            <div id="2">
                The most common cause of obesity in the world is the excessive consumption of fast foods high in refined sugar like <b>sweets, chocolates, ice-cream, donuts, cookies, biscuits, cakes, pastries, milkshakes, packaged fruit juices, aerated drinks, energy drinks</b> etc.\n\n

Being a sugar addict, I completely understand how difficult it really is to stay away from our sugar cravings, especially after having a spicy meal, even for a single day! Despite knowing the consequences of sugar consumption, I found it almost impossible to eliminate sugar from my nutrition plan.\n\n

Whenever I managed to stay away from it for a couple of days, I again used to get back on my usual unhealthy eating habits of consuming ice-creams, milkshakes, biscuits and pastries right after a meal (my mouth’s watering right now!). I just couldn’t stay away from them until I came across the fact that:-

                \n\n<b>It’s all about replacing unhealthy tasty stuff with something SIMILAR IN TASTE and simultaneously HEALTHY AS WELL, instead of just completely eliminating anything unhealthy that tastes great.</b>\n\n

After some experimenting, I came across some of the healthiest foods on the planets that are sweet as well! And I’m sure that these healthy foods will definitely help you stay away from the unhealthy sugary stuff.\n\n
                Some of the excellent replacements of sugar rich foods are:-\n\n

            <div id="2">
                "Firstly, let’s understand what \'WHEY PROTEIN\' is, by clicking "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5LSzkdl-ok">"<font color="blue">here."</font></a>\n\n

First of all, let’s clear the myth that ‘whey protein’ is harmful for all of us, especially children who haven’t reached their adolescence. Whey protein is a high quality protein which is absorbed by our body instantly for its proper growth and development.\n\n

There is literally
            </div>
            <div id="2">
                <b>NO AGE LIMIT</b> for the consumption of whey protein. You may ask why? The simple answer is that the first thing we all have consumed when we were born was whey protein!! You may ask how? The answer is through ‘BREAST MILK’.
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <i>The protein in human breast milk is 60-80% \'whey\' and the rest being \'casein\'</i>. So that\'s a strong enough reason why whey protein is good for all age groups.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="4">
                <i><li>"For more info about \'human breast milk composition\', click "<a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/first-year-of-life/whats-in-breastmilk/"><font color="blue">"here."</font></a></li></i>\n\n

So the real question here is: - “Are ‘whey protein SUPPLEMENTS’ harmful?”\n\n

All of us might have definitely heard from the doctors that whey protein supplements are harmful. Well, that’s because most of those doctors DON\'T have sound knowledge and experience in \'RESISTANCE TRAINING\' and \'SUPPLEMENTATION\'.\n\n

                Let’s have a look at what
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <b>Dr. Ashwin Vijay, the Director of ‘Strength India Movement’</b>, who is a DOCTOR and has good experience in resistance training and supplementation, has to say about whey protein supplements, by clicking
            </div>
            <div id="6">
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TypOVXl_Yzc"><font color="blue">here.</font></a>\n\n


From the above video, you might have got an idea of the benefits of whey protein supplements, provided you are consuming them in MODERATION, the upper limit being not more than 2 heaping scoops per day.\n\n

If you are still not satisfied, then your next question to me would be:-\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="6.1">
                <i>“Have you consumed whey protein supplements? If not, then who the hell are you to advocate these supplements?”</i>\n\n
And my answer to that would be:- YES! I HAVE CONSUMED whey protein supplements, and I have been consuming them for more than a year(as of Sept 2018). And honestly, I have NEVER experienced any negative side effects as I have always kept my daily intake not more than 2 heaping scoops per day. I have been consuming them to supplement my daily protein requirements, as I wasn’t able to get enough protein through natural food sources for proper recovery from my intense workouts.\n\n

As I weigh 60kg, my minimum protein requirement per day for optimum muscle growth and recovery should be\n\n
                1.6g of protein/kg x 60kg = 96g of protein.\n\n
                Our hostel mess food consumed throughout the day would contain no more than 50g of protein, which is clearly not enough. So I supplement my protein intake through peanuts and 2 heaping scoops of whey protein supplement (1 heaping scoop = 20g of protein), to complete my incomplete protein demand.\n\n

This is not the case when I am at home. I get sufficient protein (at least 30g per meal) through EXTREMELY DELICIOUS ‘MOM-MADE’ food at home. So there is absolutely no need for me to consume whey protein supplements at home.\n\n

I have NO \'kidney or liver related problems\', and neither am I \'lactose intolerant\'. Due to this, it’s completely safe for me to consume whey protein supplements. But if you do have any of the above issues, then ‘whey protein’ as well as ‘whey protein SUPPLEMENTS’ can be detrimental for you! Despite taking care of all the above conditions including daily dosage limits, if you still experience side effects like bloating, vomiting, increased bowel movements, nausea etc. then simply AVOID IT! There are people who are unable to properly digest even the healthiest natural protein sources like eggs, peanuts etc. as EVERY HUMAN BODY IS \'UNIQUE\'. Just LISTEN TO YOUR BODY and stick to the protein sources that your body can easily digest without any side effects.\n\n

Now, if you are a very skeptical person like ‘Skyler White’ (you know what I mean xD), whose popular dialogue is:-

            <div id="12">
                <i>MuscleBlaze Whey Energy (chocolate flavoured)</i>, as it’s tastier.\n\n

The following image shows the \'nutritional information\' of the \'UNFLAVOURED Raw Whey Protein Supplement\'.\n

    <string name="nutridd_myth1_2">
        <font color="black" face="times new roman">
            <div id="1">
                From the nutritional info, we find that 1 scoop (30g) contains 122 kcal, 24g protein, 2.1g carbohydrates, 0g added sugar, 1.95g fats, all 9 \'Essential Amino Acids\' (EAAs) in adequate proportions, some \'Semi-Essential Amino Acids\' (SEAAs). BCAAs are \'Branched Chain Amino Acids\' namely <i>Leucine, Isoleucine and Valine</i>, which are a part of the 9 EAAs.\n\n
You might be wondering that SEAAs or Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAAs) are the ones that our body produces adequately and so there is absolutely no need for dietary consumption of NEAAs. But as far as research is concerned, there is no experimental data available till date that substantiates this assumption.
            </div>
            <div id="2">

As even natural food sources contain NEAAs, consumption of these NEAAs through this protein supplement ISN\'T going to HAMPER the NATURAL PRODUCTION of NEAAs in our body in any way.\n\n
So, to sum up, the above nutritional info regarding the above supplement clearly DOESN\'T seem to contain any harmful chemicals.\n\n
Now let’s move to the ingredients used in this supplement, which is depicted by the image shown below.\n

            <div id="4">
                <b>completely safe for consumption</b> as we HAVEN\'T found any harmful chemicals added in it.\n\n

\n(Folic acid :- Vitamin B9 ;\n
Pantothenic acid:- Vitamin B5 ;\n

This is a very popular myth especially amongst our PARENTS who have always asked their kids NOT TO JOIN A GYM for this particular reason.\n\n

This myth is based on the theory that heavy weight lifting like an overhead press can compress your bones (namely spine and leg bones) leading to stunted height growth.\n\n

Well, that does make sense if you are unaware of the science behind height growth (lengthening of bones). The truth is that there HASN’T been any scientific research till date which relates stunted height growth with weight lifting.\n\n

But then one day, I tried to find out what was actually inside these foods that made them so ‘bad’. To my surprise, there was NOTHING WRONG with the nutrient composition of these foods.

I have already covered the topic of fat loss and muscle gain. It is definitely true without a doubt that you need to be in a state of calorie deficit to lose fat, but you DON’T have to be in a state of calorie surplus to build muscle.\n\n

So, the above theory is completely FALSE. The process of building muscle and burning fat simultaneously is known as BODY RECOMPOSTION. This ‘recomposition’ process is slower than the traditional ‘bulking’ and ‘cutting’ cycles and requires a lot more planning and carefulness while executing it.\n\n

This is one of the most common myths concerning abs. You can still find tons of videos and images on almost all social networking sites giving a list of core exercises that focus on targeting belly fat loss. Now that is simply a bunch of freaking BS!!\n\n

There is NO such exercise to burn belly fat!! It’s not just belly fat, you can find videos on YouTube that promise the burning of arm fat, chest fat, shoulder fat etc. Exercises are meant to STRENGTHEN OUR JOINTS and MUSCLES, NOT for burning fat.\n\n

The most important and sufficient factor that decides fat loss is \'CALORIE DEFICIT\'. No matter how high your sets, reps or intensity might be, if you do not maintain an overall calorie deficit throughout the day, you will NOT lose fat!!\n\n

                The so-called \'belly fat targeting core exercises\' are meant to \'strengthen our core and hip flexor muscles\', not to burn belly fat. Even if we do manage to maintain an overall calorie deficit throughout the day, <b>we will lose fat EVENLY throughout our body</b>, i.e. from our face, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, back, glutes, legs, feet and finally from our core.\n\n

The fat in our core (stubborn abdominal fat and love handles) are the FIRST ones to accumulate in a state of calorie surplus, and are simply the LAST ones to disappear in a state of calorie deficit. This means that you will experience fat loss from your core only after the occurrence of fat loss from all other areas of your body!\n\n

If you can’t buy this, then let’s for once believe the above hypothesis to be true. If that’s the case, then just imagine how WEIRD people might start to appear when they have some parts of their body completely free from fat and some parts completely surrounded by fat.

                You might be wondering why the hell is this app turning out into a boring biology class xD!! I completely understand that. Even I used to hate biology in my schooling (no offence to those who love it, it’s just my personal opinion). But physical fitness is literally NOTHING without BIOCHEMISTRY and BIOMECHANICS. Having no idea about the muscles being worked whilst performing a particular exercise is like having no idea of the pros and cons of eating a particular food item.\n\n
                You need to have an answer to the questions like ‘why’, ‘what’, ‘how’ and ‘where’ regarding a particular exercise, in order to perform it CORRECTLY and SAFELY. The part of the answer to the ‘why’ question is:-

                <i>"Which muscle group does the exercise work?"</i> Don’t worry; you don’t have to go too deep into \'muscle anatomy\'. You just need to know the \'basics of the muscular system\', \'types of muscle fibres\' and the \'major muscle groups\' in our body.\n\n

                As far as \'natural posture\' is concerned, both APT and PPT are termed as \'bad postures\' as they can lead to problems in the \'lumbar spine\' (lower back) in the longer run.\n\n
                <b>But as far as exercise execution is concerned, PPT can be BENEFICIAL as it helps to \'activate the glutes and core muscles\'.</b> PPT is always maintained while performing almost all core related exercises like planche, deadlift, front lever, back lever, handstand, L-sit etc.

            <div id="2">
                You might have heard this advice a million times from people and from the internet on how to set your goals to achieve something big in your life. And undoubtedly, this is the MOST IMPORTANT advice in fitness too. Without proper goal setting, you will only end up wasting your time, energy and money.\n\n
                The goals may differ from person to person. As far as fitness is concerned, some of the different types of goals are:-\n\n
•	Fat loss\n\n
•	Muscle gain\n\n
•	Both fat loss and muscle gain simultaneously\n\n
•	Strength gain\n\n
•	Speed improvement\n\n
•	Stamina improvement\n\n
•	Cardiovascular endurance improvement\n\n
•	Muscular endurance improvement\n\n
•	Mastering a sport\n\n
•	Powerlifting competition\n\n
•	Bodybuilding competition\n\n
•	Achieving gymnastics and calisthenics skills\n\n
•	Flexibility and mobility improvement\n\n
And the list goes on and on…\n\n\n

You might have heard of the popular saying:-\n\n
                <i>“A goal without a plan is just a wish!”</i>\n\n
                The reason why you need to set or pick a particular goal is because
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>different goals have different action plans</b>. You can’t follow the same training routine to achieve different goals simultaneously. Picking some random training plan is only going to give you random results.
            </div>
            <div id="4">
                <b>The FASTEST way to achieve a specific goal is to have a SPECIFIC ACTION PLAN (training plan)</b>. Let me give you some examples to explain what exactly I mean by this.\n\n
•	Powerlifting training, strength training, hypertrophy (muscle gain) training and endurance training are different things. All of them have different training plans. So, choosing a specific training plan for achieving a specific goal from the above is the best way to go. Expecting optimum muscle hypertrophy by following the other training plans is a waste of time. We will discuss about these types of training in more detail later.\n\n
•	If you want to improve your CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE for a marathon, then \'speed training\' WON’T help you in any way.\n\n
•	If you want to improve your SMASHING POWER in badminton, then the best way to achieve it would be to actually \'practise your smash regularly\'.\n\n
                •	Instead of focusing on attaining various gymnastic or calisthenics skills simultaneously, it would be much better to shift your focus on attaining only \'ONE skill AT A TIME\'. I know that sounds boring, and it actually is boring to train for only one skill at a time till you attain it, but unfortunately it’s this boring stuff that’s going to take you faster towards attaining that skill. That applies to other things in life as well.
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <b>Focusing and working towards ONE GOAL AT A TIME is the FASTEST way to achieve it</b>.\n\n\n

Another important thing to remember is that as different individuals have different goals, COMPARING your progress with that of others is simply UNNECESSARY. Even if they have the same goal as that of yours, every individual has got a \'UNIQUE CAPACITY\', \'SPEED OF LEARNING\' and \'ADAPTING TO CHANGE\', and so, comparing yourself with others even in this situation ISN’T a good idea.
            </div>

            <div id="2">
                Any physical activity that significantly increases your breathing rate and heart rate (cardiovascular activity) can be considered as a cardiovascular exercise or simply ‘cardio’. The reason why these exercises are termed as ‘cardiovascular’ is not simply because they increase your cardiovascular activity, but more importantly they IMPROVE YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. Depending on the intensity, cardio exercises can be classified as <b>Low Intensity Steady State (LISS) cardio</b> and
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) cardio</b>.\n\n

There are hundreds of different types of cardio exercises. Some of the most common exercises among them are:-\n\n
•	Brisk walking\n\n
•	Slow to fast jogging\n\n
•	Sprinting\n\n
•	Swimming\n\n
•	Cycling\n\n
•	Sports (football, badminton, tennis, basketball, volleyball, cricket etc.)\n\n
•	Athletics\n\n
•	Dancing\n\n
•	Tabata\n\n
•	Zumba or dance workout\n\n
•	Skipping\n\n\n
The problem with today’s society is that due to the \'high calorie burning rate\' of cardio exercises, these exercises have been equated to \'fat loss\'. Whenever anyone hears the term ‘fat loss’, the first thing that comes in his/her mind is ‘cardio’.  Due to this mentality, most of the people today start doing endless cardio sessions from \'Jan 1 every year\' (you know why) in order to lose body fat and get to their dream muscular physique, which is far from the best way of achieving it.\n\n
Cardio exercises cannot lead to significant muscle gain as these exercises only activate your ‘Type I’ or \'slow twitch\' muscle fibres. For muscle hypertrophy, your need to activate your ‘Type IIa’ and ‘Type IIx’ muscle fibres (\'fast twitch\' muscle fibres). And also, despite the high calorie burning rate of cardio exercises, you WON’T experience any fat loss if you AREN’T in a ‘net Calorie deficit’ or your daily net Calorie consumption (Calories through food – Calories burnt by any physical activity) is above your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).\n\n
So, looking at cardio exercises through a ‘fat loss’ perspective is simply a FOOLISH idea! These exercises can ‘AID’ you in attaining a \'Calorie deficit\', but CANNOT certainly ‘GUARANTEE’ you one!\n\n
Therefore, a better perspective to look at cardio exercises would be to simply consider their other important benefits like:-\n\n
•	Improved heart health\n\n
•	Improved lung capacity\n\n
•	Reduced risk of heart diseases, high serum cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, cancer etc.\n\n
•	Improved stamina, speed and endurance\n\n
•	Improved confidence and energy levels\n\n
•	Improved mood due to release of endorphins\n\n
•	Temporary relief from depression, anxiety and stress\n\n
•	Improved sleep\n\n\n

            <div id="2">
                Resistance training is any form of physical activity that involves your skeletal muscles (<i>Type I, Type IIa and Type IIx muscle fibres</i>) to work against a \'RESISTIVE FORCE\'. The \'resistive force\' can be provided by literally any external weight like a
            </div>
            <div id="3">

            <div id="4">
                <i>“What’s the difference between cardio and resistance training?”</i>\n\n

The main difference between cardio and resistance training is that most of the cardio exercises train your cardiovascular endurance and activate mostly Type I muscle fibres. Some HIIT exercises do activate your Type IIa and Type IIx muscle fibres, but they don’t necessarily train your muscles to be stronger. On the other hand, all resistance training exercises activate all the 3 muscle fibre types, leading to an increase in \'muscular strength\', \'endurance\' and \'hypertrophy\'.\n\n

Resistance training can be broadly categorised into the following types depending on individual goals:-\n\n

There are tons and tons of different exercises that can be performed in a gym.\n\n
But fortunately, you don’t have to do a hell lot of different exercises over there in order to build strength, muscle and endurance. Just performing the exercises mentioned in this section would be MORE THAN SUFFICIENT for building your \'DREAM PHYSIQUE\'.\n\n
                There are 2 broad categories of exercises that can be performed in a gym. They are:-\n\n
•	Compound exercises\n\n
•	Isolation exercises\n\n

            <div id="2">
                Compound exercises are the exercises that activate MULTIPLE MUSCLE GROUPS simultaneously. Below mentioned are some of the merits and demerits of compound exercises.\n\n
                <b><font size="20">Merits:-</font></b>\n\n
•	Help to quickly build overall body strength\n\n
•	Help in saving time as multiple muscles are trained simultaneously\n\n
•	Burn more calories due to multiple muscle activation\n\n
•	Improve intra-muscular coordination\n\n
•	Elevate heart rate\n\n
•	Improve overall joint flexibility and mobility\n\n
•	Help to gain muscle mass evenly throughout the body\n\n
•	Helps improve posture\n\n
•	They simulate real-world movements, eventually helping in building strength for everyday living (lifting a heavy suitcase, lowering a heavy suitcase from the top shelf slowly and safely to the ground, washing clothes etc.)\n\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b><font size="20">Demerits:-</font></b>\n\n
•	Performing these exercises with IMPROPER FORM can lead to SERIOUS INJURIES in the short as well as long term. Due to this \'PROPER WEIGHT SELECTION\' is absolutely CRUCIAL to perform the movement correctly in order to stay injury free.\n\n
•	The benefits of compound exercises may differ from person to person depending on his/her height, limb length, anatomical limits for range of motion etc. Due to this, the extent of activation of specific muscle groups might be different for everyone. For example, a squat can lead to better activation of the quadriceps of a shorter individual, as compared to a taller one. Advanced exercises like
            </div>
            <div id="3.1">
                <i>front lever, back lever and planche</i> require balancing of the upper body and lower body using our \'ARMS\' as the \'FULCRUM\'. These exercises get significantly TOUGHER with INCREASE in the \'length of the arms and legs\'. Due to this, these exercises tend to become MORE challenging for TALLER individuals.\n\n
•	It would be impossible for you to perform compound exercises if you are recovering from an injury. In such situations, isolation exercises come in handy. For example, if you are recovering from a shoulder injury, then you literally won’t be able to do any pushing and pulling compound exercise that requires even a slight manipulation of that particular shoulder joint. You would however be able to do isolation exercises like the cable tricep extension or a bicep curl with lighter weights. (This is based on my experience with ‘shoulder impingement’).\n\n\n

Now let’s move on to the basic and the most important compound exercises that need to be incorporated in your training regime in the gym.\n\n

Now, it’s very important for you to improve your HIP MOBILITY in order to squat deep. If you are an \'Asian\' or an \'Indian\' like me, who uses ‘Asian’ or ‘Indian style’ toilets (squat toilets), then squatting deep would be a ‘cakewalk’ for you.\n\n

This is because we \'Asians\' are used to squatting deep since our birth as we need to be in a ‘deep squatting position’ while pooping in ‘squat toilets’, instead of being in a ‘seated position’ while using ‘western style’ toilets. The ‘deep squatting position’ can turn into a ‘resting position’ for those who are used to ‘squat toilets’.\n\n

So, a good way to improve your hip mobility for achieving the deep squat would be to either use ‘squat toilets’ or to simply practice pooping on western style toilets by keeping both feet on the sides of the toilet seat instead of sitting on it.\n\n

            <div id="2">
                This section is only for INTERMEDIATE or ADVANCED lifters who have been lifting for \'AT LEAST 2 YEARS\'. If you HAVEN’T, then it would be better to just SKIP THIS SECTION because as a beginner, no matter what exercise program you follow, you will definitely progress quickly in strength training.\n\n

But when time passes by and when you slowly get into intermediate levels of strength and fitness, you will start to experience a drastic reduction in your PROGRESSION SPEED in STRENGTH GAINS. You will start to realise that you have been stuck at a PARTICULAR WEIGHT or REPS for one or more exercises.\n\n

This is the time when you kind of get a ‘reality check’. Despite keeping everything in check and busting your a** in the gym every single time, you just CAN’T seem to get past the number which you are stuck at. Don’t worry. This happens to all of us at some point of time in fitness. Instead of getting demotivated and giving up, you need to incorporate some changes in your fitness routine in order to get past your PESKY STRENGTH PLATEAUS.\n\n\n


There are 2 types of strengths:- <i>ABSOLUTE strength and RELATIVE strength</i>.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                •	<b>Absolute strength:-</b>\n\n
Absolute strength is the maximum amount of force exerted, regardless of muscle or body size. Greater amounts of absolute strength favour those with higher body weight and in general, larger individuals. Greater absolute strength will improve relative strength capabilities. For example, the maximum load that you can lift in all barbell and dumbbell based exercises is a measure of absolute strength.\n\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="4">
                •	<b>Relative strength:-</b>\n\n
Relative strength is the amount of strength to body size, or how strong you are for your size. This reflects a person\'s ability to control or move their body through space, a vital trait in athletics. All else being equal, smaller individuals have higher relative strength.\n\n\n

            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <b>Relative Strength</b>    =    \n<i>(Absolute Strength)  /  (Bodyweight)</i>\n\n\n

This is a term used to define the maximum capacity for you to lift your own bodyweight. In other words, it is completely relative to you. Relative strength is usually related to calisthenic/body weight based movements. For example, your performance in any bodyweight movement is a measure of your relative strength.\n\n

This means that an individual who has high absolute strength MAY or MAY NOT have high relative strength due to his heavy bodyweight (absolute strength to bodyweight ratio). And conversely, an individual who has low absolute strength MAY or MAY NOT have low relative strength.\n\n\n

            <div id="8">

                <b>NOTE:-</b> When it comes to improving your \'ABSOLUTE strength\', you MUST BE in a \'calorie SURPLUS\' (200-300 Calories above TDEE). But you DON’T necessarily have to be in a calorie surplus to build \'RELATIVE strength\'. Obviously you MUST be a POSITIVE NITROGEN BALANCE in both cases.\n\n

                Instead, you need to be in a \'slight calorie DEFICIT\' (200-300 Calories below TDEE) in order to build RELATIVE strength, because as your bodyweight drops, your absolute strength will definitely drop, but due to your lower bodyweight, any bodyweight exercise may get easier, thereby improving your relative strength. In both cases, staying too above or too below your TDEE won’t help you progress. So, make sure you <b>stay close to your TDEE in both cases</b>.\n\n\n

Another important way of breaking through \'rep based plateaus\' (both absolute and relative strength plateaus) is to actually focus specifically on that exercise for 2 to 3 months religiously.

            <div id="11">

The main problem with GtG is that it’s definitely NOT PRACTICAL to APPLY IT in our busy day to day life. As I have tried it myself for about a week, it does work in breaking the rep based plateau, but it’s extremely monotonous, boring and impractical.\n\n

You can SUCCESSFULLY APPLY this training routine if you have CONSTANT ACCESS to a \'pull up bar\' or a \'gym\' THROUGHOUT the day for about 4 weeks. Clearly, this ISN’T PRACTICAL at all.\n\n

A BETTER training routine that can help in increasing reps as well as be PRACTICALLY APPLICABLE is shown in
            </div>
            <div id="14">
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=012g6ZX51s0"><font color="blue">this video</font></a>.\n\n\n


Another important way of increasing the reps of a particular exercise (above 10 reps) would be to
            </div>
            <div id="15">
                <b>SIMPLY INCREASE THE INTENSITY</b> (weight or resistance) of every rep in order to manage a
            </div>
            <div id="16">
                <b>MAXIMUM OF 5 REPS PER SET</b>. This is basically the adoption of the ‘basic principle’ of STRENGTH TRAINING (increased intensity and lower reps) for breaking through rep based plateaus. This applies to almost any exercise.\n\n

For example, if you can’t get past 10 reps in pull ups (relative strength), then simply increase the intensity by performing WEIGHTED PULL UPS (bodyweight + extra weight) for
            </div>
            <div id="17">
                <b>2-5 RM</b> for about
            </div>
            <div id="18">
                <b>5-8 sets</b> per training session. Make sure you take rest for at least
            </div>
            <div id="19">
                <b>5 minutes</b> between each set.\n\n

This training style can definitely make the normal bodyweight pull ups a lot easier after 2-3 months of consistent training and you’ll surely end up doing a lot more reps of bodyweight pull ups, provided you are EATING CLOSE TO YOUR TDEE and SLEEPING ENOUGH.\n\n\n


Sometimes, it can become increasingly difficult to keep increasing the volume and intensity by performing strict sets. In such situations, if you want to keep increasing the amount of volume using the same or even higher intensity,

            <div id="2">
                <b><font color="red" size="20">DROPPING THE WEIGHTS</font></b>\n\n
This is very prevalent in almost all gyms and I just don’t understand what exactly do the gym ‘bros’ want to express through this act. I have literally seen advanced lifters do this mistake every now and then. This seriously pisses me off every time I step into the gym. This is one of the reasons why I love to train calisthenics (bodyweight training) outside the gym in order to avoid such stuff.\n\n
Dropping weights especially dumbbells and barbell plates on the floor not only damages it, but also creates a lot of unnecessary noise. This can also lead to serious injuries if someone accidentally comes near these ‘bros’. This definitely distracts others in the gym too.\n\n

            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>SOLUTION:-</b> ALWAYS LOWER THE WEIGHTS SLOWLY TO THE GROUND WITHOUT MAKING ANY SOUND. YOU MUST ‘RESPECT’ THE WEIGHTS AND EQUIPMENTS THAT HELP YOU BUILD MUSCLE AND STRENGTH!\n\n

By doing so, you will not only prevent the problems associated with it, but you will also unintentionally perform ‘Deadlift eccentrics’ which can help in improving your ‘grip strength’ as well as ‘pulling strength’, which is why you are in the gym in the first place!\n\n

Also, as mentioned earlier, lowering the weights slowly to the ground is also a gesture of ‘respect’ towards them. I know that sounds funny, but you ‘MUST RESPECT and VALUE’ almost anything or anybody that help you get better and stronger!\n\n

Now I’m not saying to make absolutely ZERO SOUND while lowering the barbell during a Deadlift, as some ‘thudding’ sound is inevitable while performing them. In this case, just make sure you try your best to LIMIT THE SPEED of the Deadlift ‘descent’.\n\n

But as mentioned earlier, NEVER DROP the barbells during the descent. That can cause more problems than dropping a dumbbell would.\n\n\n

            <div id="4">
                <b><font color="red" size="20">GIVING UNSOLICITED ADVICE TO STRANGERS</font></b>\n\n
Now, this act won’t be performed by beginners as you (if you are a beginner) yourself aren’t having a very good idea about fitness. But when you slowly reach to an intermediate level of fitness where you have experienced some good results in the past, you are bound to commit such actions as you might start thinking that you have a good grasp of what’s going on. But in reality, you are in the VERY EARLY STAGES of making developments.\n\n
There are many chances that you may not know all the details and nuances about a certain topic. You also may not know the current situation or condition of the other person. So, advising some random strangers regarding a certain topic (form of exercise or anything related to fitness) can end up misleading them with incomplete information. This can lead to serious problems for them in the longer run.\n\n
Even if your input is completely correct, this act is simply NOT welcomed by anyone. Anyone who is given unsolicited advice feels as if he/she has been verbally attacked.\n\n
Sadly, even I have given unsolicited advices to some guys regarding proper form of execution. But when I started to visualise myself in their places, I realised how it actually feels when someone else does the same to you. You will literally feel like you have been attacked. From that moment onwards, I realised my mistake and completely stopped doing that and I just focused on my own business.\n\n
And I SINCERELY APOLOGISE to those whom I have given such advices.\n\n
You may think that this will HELP the other person, but in reality, it just makes you look like an ‘arrogant do****bag’! So, please DON’T commit the same mistake that I did!\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <b>SOLUTION:-</b> The most important exercise to be performed in the gym is KEEPING YOUR F***ING MOUTH SHUT AND FOCUSING ON YOUR OWN GODDAMN BUSINESS! ADVICE SOMEBODY ONLY IF THEY SEEK YOURS! PERIOD! If you really feel like someone may get hurt by what they are doing (improper gym etiquette), then just inform this to the gym staff. They will take care of the rest.\n\n\n

            <div id="6">
                <b><font color="red" size="20">LIFTING WITH EGO</font></b>\n\n
This is very common in the gym especially with beginners and intermediates. Even I used to do this earlier in the sense of pushing harder. As a beginner or an intermediate, when you watch a strong individual lifting heavier weights, your ‘ego’ gets fired up and you start questioning yourself:-\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="7">
                <i>“Why the hell can’t I lift like him/her?  Why the hell can’t I show off by lifting heavy?”</i>\n\n

In reality, the simple logical answer to that is:-\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="8">
                <i>“I am not strong enough to handle that weight. I am not strong enough at this point of time to perform \'Quality Reps\' with \'Good Form\' and \'Full Range of Motion\' using those heavy weights. Lifting those heavy weights will only make me end up ‘screwing’ my form, thereby \'increasing\' my chances of getting \'injured\'. This will simply make me look like an ‘idiot’ in front of the entire gym, which is the last thing I want. Injuries will also become a big setback in my strength gains. Period!”</i>\n\n

Now, the problem with your ego is that it does not think the logical way. You will NEVER come up with the above answer if you let your ego come in your way.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="9">
                <b>SOLUTION:-</b> LEAVE YOUR F***ING ‘EGO’ OUTSIDE THE GYM AND FOCUS ONLY ON ‘YOUR’ WORKOUT! THINK ‘REALISTICALLY’ DURING WEIGHT SELECTION! PERIOD!\n\n\n

                <b><font color="red" size="20">BLOCKING SOMEONE’S VIEW OF THE MIRROR</font></b>\n\n
The mirrors provided in the gym are NOT for checking our physique or showing off. They are provided to make sure anyone exercising in front of it performs the exercise with proper form and full range of motion (especially compound exercises like deadlifts, overhead press, barbell rows etc.). They are also provided to be able to look at your working muscles while performing the exercise (especially isolation exercises) in order to maintain good ‘MIND MUSCLE CONNECTION’
            </div>
            <div id="11">
                (Check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaYzhDRhY4g"><font color="blue">this</font></a> for more info on ‘mind muscle connection’).\n\n
So, by standing in front of ‘anyone serious about lifting’ and blocking their view of the mirror will undoubtedly PISS THEM OFF!\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="12">
                <b>SOLUTION:-</b> JUST MAKE SURE NOBODY IS USING THE MIRROR BEFORE STANDING IN FRONT OF IT. IF SOMEBODY IS USING IT, KINDLY DON’T INTERFERE AND LOOK FOR SOME OTHER SPOT. PERIOD!\n\n\n

            </div>
            <div id="13">
                <b><font color="red" size="20">SHOWING OFF</font></b>\n\n
As I mentioned earlier, the mirrors are not provided for checking your toned abs and showing it off. I have seen many intermediate and advanced lifters moving and working out in the gym shirtless just to SHOW OFF THEIR F***ING ABS!\n\n
They might be doing this with the intention of sending a message to others around that hard-work brings results. Now, that’s not a wrong message. But based on my experience, the TRUTH is that NOBODY GIVES A SH*T ABOUT YOUR ABS AND YOUR HARD-WORK!\n\n
Showing off your abs to anyone only makes them ‘ENVIOUS’ (usually beginners and intermediates) or ‘JEALOUS’ (usually advanced) and eventually ending up PISSING THEM OFF!\n\n
Gym is a VERY WRONG place to show off your physique. It’s a place to get your training done in order to meet your specific goals. It’s also a great way of distracting others in the gym. This is not only limited to the gym, but literally any public place where being shirtless and showing off only makes you look like a ‘NARCISSIST’!\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="14">
                <b>SOLUTION:-</b> DO TAKE PRIDE in your physique but DON’T SHOW OFF at the WRONG places. Choose the RIGHT PLACES to show off, the best example being the ‘beach’, where almost everyone is shirtless, or at ‘your home’ or some ‘bodybuilding competition’ or a ‘fashion show’ or a ‘photo-shoot’ or basically any place where you don’t find many people around. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE GYM, JUST GET YOUR GODDAMN TRAINING DONE AND LEAVE!! PERIOD!\n\n\n

                <b><font color="red" size="20">USING MOBILE FOR THE UNNECESSARY STUFF</font></b>\n\n

I have rarely noticed people in the gym using their mobiles to \'note down some important points as notes\', to \'refer video tutorials for some exercises\', to \'use stopwatches to measure their rest time period\', \'time taken to complete a set\' or \'recording their maximum hold time\' for isometric exercises.\n\n

What I’ve often noticed in the gym is the use of mobiles for \'online chatting\', \'surfing through Facebook and Instagram\', \'taking selfies while flexing\' and \'posting stories\' in whatsapp, FB and IG using captions such as ‘#hard_work’ , ‘#gym_time’,  ‘#never_give_up’, ‘#never_skip_leg_day’, ‘#consistency’, ‘#busting_my_a**_in_the_gym’ and so on.\n\n

My question to these people is:-\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="16">
                <i>“Are you REALLY busting your a** in the gym??”</i>\n\n

Now, this again is a sign of unnecessary show off. This not only wastes your time in the gym, but it also distracts others over there. You can surely \'take videos\' by \'demonstrating the execution of a particular exercise\', provided there are very few people around, or you can also \'surf through your favourite songs playlists\' for short time periods. But using your mobiles for doing unnecessary stuff in the gym is only going to WASTE YOUR TIME.\n\n

                <b><font color="red" size="20">USING GYM GLOVES</font></b>\n\n
Gym gloves are popular among beginners as they consider it to be an \'essential gym gear\'. And it’s not their fault. Any beginner will definitely fall into this TRAP due to \'extensive advertisement\' of gym gloves in \'online shopping websites\' and also by seeing some \'professionals wearing it\' in some \'online articles and magazines\'.\n\n
Even I was tempted into buying them in my initial workout days. Just like most beginners, even I used to think that these gloves help in improving our grip strength. After using them for almost a year and a half, I started realising that these gloves actually do the \'OPPOSITE\' of that. Yes, you read it right! These fancy looking gloves actually worsen your grip strength due to the smooth leather and fibre layers in it. These smooth layers make it very easy for the bars, barbells and dumbbells to SLIP from your hands, leading to \'poor performance\' in an exercise.\n\n
\'GRIP STRENGTH\' is NOT so important when it comes to PUSHING exercises. But your performance in PULLING exercises like \'Deadlifts\', \'pull ups\', \'hanging exercises\', \'rows\' etc. is HEAVILY DEPENDENT on your \'grip strength\'.\n\n

Calluses are \'hardened skin layers\' on your \'baby soft skin\' and their sole purpose is to PROTECT your soft skin from the \'HARSH FRICTIONAL STIMULUS\' experienced while \'pulling heavy stuff\'. This is a way of our body to ADAPT to the \'rough stimulus\' to our hands by building calluses, SIMILAR to the way our body builds muscle and strengthens our joints, tendons and ligaments to adapt to the heavy loads we lift.\n\n
Honestly, once you get used to it, your \'grip strength\' will significantly IMPROVE, eventually leading to \'IMPROVED PULLING PERFORMANCE\'. The best way to improve grip strength would be to perform
            </div>
            <div id="2">
                <i>hanging exercises</i> from the pull up bar or simply \'hanging from the bar\'. It will be very UNCOMFORTABLE in the beginning and hanging even for a few seconds would be challenging, but after one or two weeks of practice, it will definitely turn into a ‘cakewalk’. As of now, I can easily perform a

                <i>one-arm hang</i> for about 30-45 seconds.\n\n
But when it comes to exercises that involve lifting loads much heavier than your bodyweight, like Deadlifts, your toughened palms still won’t be enough to prevent the \'slipping\' of the barbell from your hands. In such cases I would definitely RECOMMEND using
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <i>‘chalk’ or ‘weightlifting straps’</i> to further improve your grip on the barbell. Just remember, unlike gym gloves, weightlifting straps or chalk won’t protect your skin against calluses, they will simply BOOST your grip.\n\n

                <b>SOLUTION:-</b> JUST THROW AWAY YOUR FANCY GYM GLOVES AND TOUGHEN UP! USE CHALK OR WEIGHTLIFTING STRAPS INSTEAD! THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IS TO ‘FACE’ THEM, INSTEAD OF ‘AVOIDING’ THEM. PERIOD!\n\n\n

Wearing shorts in the gym both by men and women can be distracting for the opposite sex especially while performing exercises involving INVERSION OF YOUR BODY UPSIDE DOWN. For example, while performing \'handstands\' or \'hanging exercises\' like ‘toes to the bar’, ‘inverted hang’, ‘inverted deadlifts’, ‘windshield wipers’, ‘front and back lever eccentrics’, ‘skin the cat’ etc.\n\n
 While performing such exercises, there are chances of \'unintentional exposure\' of your \'undergarments\' due to the slipping of your shorts towards your waist due to gravity. This can be embarrassing and distracting especially for the opposite sex.\n\n

                <b>SOLUTION:-</b> SIMPLY WEAR FULL LENGTH SPORTS PANTS (MEN AND WOMEN) OR FULL LENGTH LEGGINGS (WOMEN) IN ORDER TO PREVENT SUCH EMBARASSING SCENARIOS.\n\n\n

Gymnastics is a hell lot more complicated than Calisthenics. There are literally hundreds of exercises in both Gymnastics and Calisthenics. So, covering all of them is beyond the scope of this app. But we will surely be covering some of the most common moves in both Calisthenics and Gymnastics.\n\n

Before trying to attempt any advanced skill in either calisthenics or gymnastics, you need to have a

                <b>MASTER THE BASICS FIRST AT ANY COST</b> before even thinking of attempting the advanced moves.\n\n

I completely understand how attractive the advanced moves look, which eventually make you end up craving to achieve them. Don’t just jump into performing the progressions of the advanced moves because no matter how long you practice the progressions, you will only end up GETTING STUCK IN A PLATEAU and GETTING AVOIDABLE INJURIES, IF YOU SKIP THE BASICS. I have done this mistake. So, PLEASE DON’T be a ‘JERK’ LIKE ME!\n\n\n

Push Up is actually the bodyweight equivalent of a \'Flat Bench Press\'. So, if you can’t get access to a gym, and you really want to get a \'bigger chest\', then \'Push Ups\' can be the best way to get the job done.

The same applies for dips, Pull Ups, or literally any bodyweight exercise, as ‘relative strength’ comes into action while performing them.\n\n

                A <b>Pull Up</b> is an upper-body VERTICAL PULLING exercise. The \'pull up\' is a closed-chain movement where the body is suspended by the hands and is pulled up. As this happens, the elbows undergo \'FLEXION\' and the shoulders \'ADDUCT\' and extend to bring the elbows to the torso. Pull ups can be performed using a PRONATED grip, NEUTRAL grip and a SUPINATED grip.\n\n

Please keep in mind that \'Rows\' are ‘HORIZONTAL pulling’ movements, but \'Pull Ups\' are ‘VERTICAL pulling’ in nature. So, practising \'horizontal pulling movements\' won’t directly translate into improved \'vertical pulling strength\'. So, my recommendation would be to stick to the ‘easier VERTICAL pulling’ exercises as mentioned above to work your way to a \'bodyweight pull up\'.\n\n\n

            <div id="2">
                <b>Core exercises</b> include movements that activate a \'group of muscles\' called the \'core\'. These muscles work as a group to help \'stabilize and control\' the spine. These muscles are located on the midsection of the trunk and are mostly deep muscles. Activation of these muscles is possible by recruiting the right fibres in the movement.\n\n

The main core muscles include the
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <i>transverse abdominis, obliques and erector spinae</i>, but there are many other muscles that can be considered as core.\n\n

\'Core exercises\' train these muscles to work together properly to maintain proper balance, agility, posture and movement to help the body move efficiently as well as preventing injury.\n\n

As you might have learnt by now, almost \'ALL COMPOUND EXERCISES activate your CORE muscles\' for \'overall STABILIZATION\' while performing them. All exercises and skills in Calisthenics and Gymnastics HEAVILY activate your core and hip flexors. Having a weak core and weak hip flexors can lead to \'POOR performance\' in \'Intermediate\' and \'Advanced bodyweight exercises\'. Therefore, strengthening of these muscles need to be your PRIORITY if you want to PROGRESS in Calisthenics.\n\n

A good starting point to strengthen them would be to incorporate

Now, these exercises might look simple, but they are INTENSE! You will definitely feel a \'strong burning sensation\' in your \'core and hip flexors\' while doing them and it’s COMPLETELY NORMAL. These exercises will \'REALLY SUCK\' at first. But as you keep practising them consistently for some months, they will eventually get easier and you will be able to build a really strong foundational core and hip flexor strength to advance to the harder core exercises in calisthenics.\n\n

I would recommend you to practice bodyweight leg exercises only if you DON’T have access to a gym.

As the name suggests, these exercises are performed while ‘Hanging’ from a ‘Pull Up bar’ or from ‘Gymnastic Rings’, which HEAVILY activate our forearms, biceps and lats (latissimus dorsi), eventually making them HARDER. ‘GRIP STRENGTH’ also plays a VITAL role in performing these exercises.\n\n

            <div id="6">
                (<b>DANIEL VADNAL, Director of FitnessFAQs</b>) makes these exercises look very SIMPLE as he is already at an ‘Advanced level’ in ‘Calisthenics’. He can perform most of the ‘Advanced skills’ like the ‘Back Lever’, ‘Front Lever’, ‘Human Flag’, ‘Handstand Push Ups’, ‘90° Push Ups’, ‘OAP’, ‘OAC’, ‘Straddle Planche’ etc.\n\n

                So, performing the above exercises is just ‘a walk in the park’ for him. But, when you actually start practising these exercises, you will instantly realise how F***ING WEAK you really are!! You will feel a ‘STRONG BURNING sensation’ in your ‘Hip Flexors’, ‘Core’ and your Palms’ while performing even the ‘simplest’ ones among them.\n\n

                You will only be able to perform around 5 of them initially. But don’t worry. When you keep practising them consistently for about 6 months, you will definitely be able to perform all of them. During this process, you will experience a ‘huge BOOST’ in your ‘overall body strength’ and ‘self-esteem’ as well.\n\n

                The <b>L-sit</b> is an acrobatic body position and an Isometric exercise in which the entire body weight rests on the hands, with the torso held in a slightly forward-leaning orientation, with legs held horizontally so that each leg forms a nominal ‘right-angle’ with the torso.\n\n

You obviously would require some decent ‘Hip Flexor’ and ‘Core’ strength in order to achieve this, which can be acquired through \'Hanging Core exercises\'. You also need to have some \'basic Pushing strength\' to hold your entire bodyweight on two palms.\n\n

So, PLEASE make sure you are able to perform

This move can be performed on almost any flat surface (even on your ‘BED’!), on ‘Parallettes’, on Dip bars, Pull Up bars (if you can perform a ‘Muscle Up’) and on ‘Gymnastic Rings’. Performing an L-sit on the ‘Rings’ is a hell lot more difficult due to the ‘INSANE INSTABILITY’ of the ‘Rings’, which requires an additional PREREQUISITE of mastering the L-sit (on anything else) and also mastering the ‘Ring Support Hold’.\n

(Provided you have mastered the ‘floor L-sit’ as it’s more difficult on the ‘soft bed’ due to the ‘reduced distance’ between your ‘legs and the bed’ as your arms ‘depress into it’.)\n\n

            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>Body Lever</b> is an Advanced Core exercise that can help build \'excellent overall Core strength\'. It is credited to ‘martial arts master’ BRUCE LEE and is among the most advanced ones he used in his physical training.\n\n

This exercise is an ‘advanced version’ of the ‘Lying Leg Raises’. The only difference is that you need to grab your hands ‘FIRMLY’ to a ‘STURDY’ object just ‘behind your head’ for support (a bench or a vertical pole or a lower horizontal bar), and raise your ‘entire body from mid back to the toes’, keeping only your upper back grounded.\n\n

Your entire body from ‘mid back to your toes’ must be STRAIGHT and in COMPLETE TENSION while performing this move. So, you obviously need to master the ‘Lying Leg Raises’ in order to perform this. Barbell Deadlifts as well as ‘Inverted Deadlifts’ can also greatly help in strengthening your ‘lower back’ and ‘lats’ in order to perform this move.\n\n

This is because ‘strong lower back’ and ‘lats’ can help lift your ‘entire torso’ above the ground (instead of just your legs in leg raises) to turn the ‘lying leg raise’ into a Dragon Flag.\n\n

Another great exercise to strengthen your lats is obviously, ’Pull Ups’. Pull Ups not only strengthen your lats, but they also help in strengthening your biceps, forearms and shoulders for holding firmly to a support.\n\n

The closer your ‘legs’ are to the ‘ground’, the ‘harder’ this move becomes. When your body is almost ‘horizontal’ to the ‘ground’ and in the air, it almost turns into a ‘Shoulder Flag’, which is a completely horizontal’ Dragon Flag performed on a ‘vertical bar’. We will talk more about it later.\n

Clearly, Dragon Flag is almost an ‘entire body exercise’ and you definitely need ‘overall body strength’ in order to perform this. This is another reason why ‘Barbell Deadlifts’ and ‘Inverted Deadlifts’ help in preparing you for the ‘Dragon Flag’ (as they are ‘Full body exercises’ too).\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="2">
                <b>BENEFITS:-</b>\n\n
Dragon Flags help you build a very strong anterior as well as posterior chain which is essential for being able to perform Advanced Core dominant skills like the ‘Shoulder Flag’, ‘Human Flag’, ‘Back Lever’ and the ‘Front Lever’. Being able to perform this exercise definitely BOOSTS your ‘confidence’ for trying HARDER Core exercises in the future. This exercise can also help you get a ‘BULLET-PROOF’ Core :)\n\n

The ‘hollow body position’ is achieved my maintaining a PPT (Posterior Pelvic Tilt) to prevent ‘arching of the lower back’ (Anterior Pelvic Tilt) and also to optimally activate your Core muscles to perform this exercise.\n\n

            <div id="2">
                The <b>Muscle Up</b> is an intermediate level strength skill, within the domain of Calisthenics. It is a combination of a radial Pull Up, followed by a Dip. This exercise consists of 3 phases:-
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <i>the \'Pull Up\' phase, the \'Transition\' phase and the \'Dip\' phase</i>.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="4">
So, the PREREQUISITES to start training for the Muscle Up are
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <b>AT LEAST 12 Pull Ups in a row, and AT LEAST 5 straight Bar Dips in a row</b>.\n\n

Muscle Up is a great exercise to improve our \'explosive Pulling power\', which in turn helps improve our lat strength for successfully holding the ‘Front Lever’ and ‘Back Lever’.\n\n

Muscle Ups can be performed on Pull Up Bars and on Gymnastic Rings. The toughest phase of a Muscle Up is the ‘transition phase’. Clearing the transition phase and getting our chest over the Bar is almost considered as a successful Muscle Up as the ‘Dip phase’ is a lot easier.\n\n

While performing a Bar Muscle Up, we need to bring our chest towards the Bar during the transition phase, as the Bar is rigid. But in the case of ring Muscle Ups, we can bring the Rings (that are not fixed in space) towards our chest during the transition phase. Due to this, ‘Ring Muscle Ups’ are generally considered easier than ‘Bar Muscle Ups’.\n

            </div>

    </string>
    <string name="muscle_up2">
        <font color="black" face="times new roman">
            <div id="1">
\n\nAlso, Ring Muscle Ups are performed using a ‘False grip’ as it’s very difficult to perform them using a ‘Neutral grip’ as the rings aren’t fixed like the Bars. But you can use a ‘False grip’ while performing a Bar Muscle Up.\n\n
            </div>

    <string name="muscle_up3">
        <font color="black" face="times new roman">
            <div id="1">
Muscle Ups can also be performed using some momentum by ‘kipping’. The Muscle Up performed WITHOUT any \'kipping\' is termed as a ‘Strict Muscle Up’. \'Kipping Muscle Ups\' can be used an easier progression of the \'strict one\' in the initial stages. But after consistent practise, you will get strong enough to perform the ‘strict version’ as it’s the one that’s generally considered as a ‘Perfect Muscle Up’.\n\n

Once you master the Strict Muscle Up, you can start practising the ‘Slow Muscle Up’, (the usual ‘strict ones’ being quick and ‘explosive’ in nature), which is even tougher as it’s a \'PURELY STRENGTH-BASED\' move. You don’t have to master the slow version though, as the usual ‘explosive’ one is considered as the \'Standard version\' of a Muscle Up.\n\n

This is the most common and PAINFUL type of injury not only in fitness (especially Calisthenics), but even among the general population who have consistently been sitting or standing in a bad posture for years.\n\n

It’s also the most challenging to recover from a shoulder injury as you literally won’t be able to move the arm of the affected shoulder. The simplest and the most ‘trivial’ daily activities using our arms like

                <i>‘wearing clothes’, ‘washing hands’, ‘brushing our teeth’, ‘bathing’, ‘sleeping’, ‘eating’</i> etc. turn into a goddamn challenge!! Life literally turns into a living hell!\n\n

I have myself experienced ‘Shoulder Impingement’ or ‘Rotator Cuff Tendinitis’ and it TRULY SUCKS!! So, I completely understand the pain and the situation of anyone out there who is experiencing any sort of shoulder injury. This was the main reason why I decided to add the ‘injury management’ section in this app, as SH*T HAPPENS!\n\n\n

There are actually many different types of Shoulder Injuries. The most common types are:-\n\n
•	Rotator Cuff Tear\n\n
•	Shoulder Impingement (Rotator Cuff Tendinitis)\n\n
•	Dislocated shoulder\n\n
•	SLAP Tear\n\n
•	Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis)\n\n
•	Shoulder Arthritis (Shoulder Osteoarthritis)\n\n\n

            <div id="4">
                <b>NOTE:-</b> The Rehab exercises for all the above shoulder injury types are essentially the SAME. All the rehab exercises for different shoulder injury types mainly focus on ‘strengthening’ the 4 major ‘Rotator Cuff Muscles’ namely:-\n\n
•	Infraspinatus\n
•	Supraspinatus\n
•	Teres minor\n
•	Subscapularis\n\n
Strengthening the above muscles will be more than sufficient to heal or recover safely, optimally and quickly from almost any kind of shoulder injury.\n\n\n

                This is among the easiest skills in ‘freestyle Calisthenics’. The ‘bar pullover’ is easier than the ‘ring pullover’ as the bars slightly assist us towards our hips while performing it, but the Rings don’t as there’s air between them.\n\n

The resistance bands used while performing ring pullovers can help prevent your hips from dropping down into a ‘German Hang’. Once you get comfortable with the resistance bands and eventually end up not touching them while performing this move on the Rings, you can finally end up achieving the ‘unassisted’ or ‘perfect’ ring pullover.\n\n

                This skill obviously requires significant explosive Pulling strength to be able to pull high enough so that our feet get over the bar.\n

            <div id="2">
                Calisthenic exercises performed on ‘Gymnastic Rings’ or simply ‘Rings’, are termed as <b>‘ring exercises’</b>. Almost any upper body exercise (Pushing and Pulling) can be performed on Rings, by simply ‘adjusting the height’ of the Rings from any tall horizontal support (Pull Up bar, a tall horizontal pole, a tree branch etc.)\n\n
                Unfortunately, there ISN’T any exercise for the lower body on the Rings that can have a significant improvement in their strength as well as hypertrophy (muscle gain). So, we will only stick to upper body exercises on Rings.\n

    <string name="rings2">
        <font color="black" face="times new roman">
            <div id="1">
\n\nThe speciality about \'rings\' is that they AREN’T FIXED like the Pull Up bars, Dip bars, ground or any other flat surface that is fixed in space. The Rings are free to move in space and so an ‘EXTRA EFFORT’ needs to be put in, to ‘STABILISE’ the Rings while performing ‘Pushing’ exercises on them. As you have noticed, Rings need to be ‘stabilised’ only for ‘PUSHING’ exercises, NOT ‘PULLING’ exercises. Pulling exercises performed on the Rings is the same as performing them on rigid or fixed bars like Pull Up or Dip bars.\n\n
You might be wondering why? Well, let’s understand the basic ‘Physics’ behind it. You WON’T find anyone else on the internet explaining this. This explanation is purely based on my close observation on why this actually happens.\n\n
                <b>CAUTION:-</b> BORING Physics AHEAD xD!!! READ ONLY IF YOU ARE ‘INTERESTED’!!\n\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="2">
                \n\nYou may have read about the terms ‘stable equilibrium’ and ‘unstable equilibrium’ in your 11<sup><font size="10">th</font></sup> Grade Physics. The given image can clearly explain the types of equilibrium of a spherical ball on different surfaces.\n

            </div>
        </font>
    </string>
    <string name="rings3">
        <font color="black" face="times new roman">
            <div id="1">
                \n\nAs you can observe, in the case of a CONCAVE surface, if a ball is displaced from its equilibrium position, which is the bottom most position of the surface (potential energy is minimum at this point), its potential energy increases and due to this it tends to return to its initial equilibrium position. This is because every object tends to be in its ‘minimum potential energy state’. This situation is considered as <b>‘stable equilibrium’</b>. No external force is required to keep the ball at its initial stable position.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="2">
                In the case of a CONVEX surface, the ball initially at the top most point has ‘maximum potential energy’, which is the most ‘unstable’ position. As any other point on this surface will lead to a reduction of the ball’s potential energy, a slight displacement of the ball will lead to more and more displacement of the ball until it reaches its ‘minimum potential energy’ state. In this case, the ball never returns to its initial position. This situation is considered as <b>‘unstable equilibrium’</b>. Here, some external force must be constantly provided to keep the ball at its initial unstable position.\n\n
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                In the case of a FLAT surface, the ball once displaced, does not return to its initial position as every point on the flat surface has the ‘same potential energy’. This situation is considered as <b>‘neutral equilibrium’</b>.\n\n

Now, there aren’t any cases of ‘neutral equilibrium’ in physical fitness. Our body can be in a state of ‘neutral equilibrium’ only when we are completely lying down horizontal on a flat surface.\n\n

Another example of the equilibrium types which can be easily correlated with our Pulling and Pushing exercises on Rings is that of a ‘PENDULUM’.\n

            </div>
        </font>
    </string>
    <string name="rings4">
        <font color="black" face="times new roman">
            <div id="1">
\n\nI have labelled the above images as Pulling and Pushing exercises because our body is in ‘stable equilibrium’ while performing ‘Pulling’ exercises and in an ‘unstable equilibrium’ while performing Pushing exercises. This applies to both Rings as well as anything fixed like a Pull Up bar, Dip bars, floor etc. I’ll explain why.\n\n
Consider our ‘body’ as the ‘bob of the pendulum’, our ‘arms’ as the ‘string or wire of the pendulum’ and our ‘palms’ as the ‘pivot point of the pendulum’.\n\n
When we start swinging slightly while hanging from anything (fixed or unfixed support), our body automatically comes back to rest vertically below the support after some time. No matter how many times we swing, we will come back to our initial position after some time. This is clearly a condition of ‘stable equilibrium’. This applies to both fixed bars as well as Rings. This is the reason why any ‘hanging’ or ‘pulling’ exercise performed on rings is same as performing them on fixed bars.\n

            </div>
        </font>
    </string>
    <string name="rings5">
        <font color="black" face="times new roman">
            <div id="1">
\n\nOn the other hand, when we try to perform a ‘support hold’ on the fixed parallel bars, straight bars or Pull Up bar (during a Muscle Up), our muscles are constantly engaged throughout the support hold. We don’t have to engage any of our muscles while hanging though. This is because hanging is already a ‘stable’ position where our potential energy is ‘minimum’. But our potential energy is ‘maximum’ during a ‘support hold’, which makes it an ‘unstable’ position. This is clearly a case of ‘unstable equilibrium’. This condition becomes even more unstable when we perform advanced exercises like ‘Handstands’ on the bars.\n
            </div>
        </font>
    </string>
    <string name="rings6">
        <font color="black" face="times new roman">
            <div id="1">
\n\nThe ‘instability’ further ‘increases’ with ‘reduction in friction’ between your palms and the bars (when there’s water or sweat or oil or any other lubricant between your palms and the bar).  Conversely, the instability can be ‘reduced’ by having a ‘better grip’ (high friction between your palms and the bars) and performing pushing exercises on something rigid like Pull Up bars, parallel bars, straight bars, parallettes, the ground etc.\n\n
These unstable positions ‘force’ our body to unintentionally either lean forward or backward. In order to stay at the top position, we need to constantly provide ‘opposite reaction forces’ using our palms to the ‘random’ forward and backward leans of our body. This constant process of providing reaction forces in short time intervals leads to the generation of ‘vibrations’ in our body, our hands and ultimately our palms.\n\n
These vibrations are ‘dampened’ or ‘absorbed’ by rigid supports, which is exactly what makes pushing exercises on them easier than on the ‘FREE’ rings. As rings AREN’T rigid, they are ‘free to move’ in space, and so they DON’T ‘absorb’ or ‘dampen’ the vibration of our palms while being in an unstable position, resulting in the ‘vibration of the rings along with our body’. So, the vibration or ‘instability’ of the rings is simply the representation of the vibration or ‘instability’ of our body. In simpler words, it’s OUR BODY that’s unstable, NOT the Rings!!\n

    <string name="rings7">
        <font color="black" face="times new roman">
            <div id="1">
\n\nIn order to limit the vibration of our ‘palms’ and ultimately the ‘rings’, we need to activate more ‘stabiliser muscles’ in our body to generate a higher vertical force to maintain our body in an ‘unstable equilibrium’. This is the reason why even the simplest pushing exercises on Rings turn into a challenge. For example, anyone who can perform around 15 parallel bar Dips in a row, will be able to manage only 5 Ring Dips in a row!\n\n
That’s why anyone in an \'intermediate strength level\' can replace ‘weighted parallel bar Dips’ with ‘Ring Dips’ to get stronger. The same applies for any other pushing exercise on rings like ‘Pelican Push Ups’, ‘L-sit’, ‘Handstand’, ‘Elbow Lever’, ‘Handstand Push Up’, ‘Planche’,’ Maltese’ etc.\n

\n\nAnother point to note is that the ‘vibration of the rings’ depends on the ‘length of the individual’s arms or overall height’, and the ‘distance of the rings from the pivot point’ (horizontal support).  Let’s understand why.\n

            <div id="5">

            </div>
            <div id="3">
                <b>Elbow Planche</b> is performed by leveraging your bodyweight against one or both elbows while balancing on your hand(s) with your body outstretched, typically in a horizontal position. As you can see, our ‘entire body’ acts as ‘lever’ where our ‘elbows supported on our forearms’ act as the ‘fulcrum’.\n

\n\nIn all levers in Calisthenics, our ‘arms’ act as the ‘fulcrum’, our ‘lower body’ acts as the ‘load’ and our ‘upper body’ generates the ‘effort’ to balance the ‘load’ (lower body), to keep the entire ‘lever’ horizontal to the ground.\n\n

The ‘One Arm Elbow Lever’ is an advanced move, so we will only focus on Elbow Lever on ‘both arms’. The arms are usually placed near our ‘waistline’, which is the location of our body’s ‘centre of gravity’. Elbow Lever can be performed on literally any flat surface.\n\n

Elbow Lever is similar to a ‘Bent Arm Planche’. The only difference is that our elbows are ‘in contact’ with our Core in an Elbow Lever, as compared to the elbows being ‘beside’ our Core in the ‘Bent Arm Planche’.  As we are stronger in any bent arm position, this move is obviously a prerequisite to master, before even thinking of training for the

            <div id="2">
                A <b>Handstand</b> is the act of supporting the body in a stable, inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic handstand, the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart and the legs together.\n\n

Handstand is very important prerequisite for many Advanced Pushing Skills like

            <div id="3">
                <i>‘Handstand Push Ups’, ‘90° Push Up’, ‘One Arm Handstand’, ‘Planche’, ‘Maltese’, ‘Inverted Cross’</i> etc. Handstand is mostly a balance-based Skill and it does not require significant strength to perform. A prerequisite pushing strength of

            <div id="4">
                <b>‘20 Push Ups in a row’</b> would suffice.\n\n
Handstand requires significant balance, coordination and focus while performing it, which obviously recruits a lot of stabiliser muscles throughout our body. This is because as discussed earlier, there CANNOT be any body position except the ‘One Arm Handstand’ that can be more unstable than the ‘Two Arm Handstand’. It usually takes ‘AT LEAST 1-2 months of consistent practise’ to successfully achieve a proper handstand. Handstand can be performed on any flat surface, parallettes, parallel bars, straight bars and rings.\n

He mentioned to push through our ‘finger tips’ when our legs start moving ‘forward’. Conversely, we need to ‘push’ through the ‘base of our palms’ when our ‘legs’ start moving ‘backward’. In this way, we need to keep our legs vertically over our palms by constantly alternating between Pushing through our finger tips and our palms.\n\n

            <div id="2">
                A <b>Pistol Squat</b>, also known as a ‘One-legged’ or ‘Single Leg Squat’, is an advanced \'unilateral\' bodyweight exercise where you squat using only one leg.
            </div>
            <div id="3">
                This is the 2<sup><font size="10">nd</font></sup> hardest variation of the bodyweight squats after the ‘Shrimp Squat’.\n\n

This exercise not only requires significant lower body strength, but as it’s a \'unilateral\' move, it also involves the activation of stabiliser muscles to help us maintain balance.
            </div>
            <div id="4">
                The <i>‘Archer Squat’, ‘Single Leg Box Squat’ and ‘Assisted Pistol Squats’</i> are sufficient prerequisite exercises to achieve the pistol squat. You can perform ‘Assisted Pistol Squats’ using either Rings or some vertical support.\n\n

Now, this is not a very difficult move if you have already developed decent lower body strength through ‘Barbell Squats’. So, achieving this move is not very difficult. This move also gets easier when you have a low body fat percentage. It WON’T take more than 2 months to achieve this move.\n\n

You will definitely reach a point when you will start to find this move easy. So, if you are not very serious about training your legs then you can get away by just performing this exercise. But if you really want strong and muscular legs, then I would definitely recommend you to keep practising Barbell squats or ‘Weighted Pistol Squats’ in order to continue getting stronger.\n

            <div id="2">
                The <b>Shrimp Squat</b> is a challenging single-leg unilateral bodyweight squat where instead of being positioned in front of the body as it is with the pistol, when you perform a shrimp squat, your ‘non-squatting leg’ is held ‘behind’ the body.\n\n

This move is very similar to the ‘Bulgarian split squat’. The only difference is that the leg at the behind is not resting on a support, but you are rather using your antagonist muscles in your Hamstrings to keep them folded in the initial progression. So, this exercise does work your hamstrings to some extent.\n\n

The toughest progression of this squat would be to ‘completely fold’ our ‘back leg’ using our ‘one hand’ and using the other hand to balance while performing this move. This move also requires some extra ‘hip and ankle mobility’ as compared to ‘Pistol Squats’. This is the reason why this move is slightly TOUGHER than the pistol squat.\n

This exercise involves kneeling on a pad (for knee comfort) and lowering under control while the ankles are held in place by a partner, a loaded Barbell, or any other immovable object.\n\n
Then extend the hamstring muscles to lean forward from the knee, not from the hip.\n\n

                The <b>Handstand Push Up</b> also called the ‘HSPU’ or the ‘Inverted Push Up’ is a type of Push Up exercise where the body is positioned in a handstand. This is essentially a ‘vertical push’ involving ‘flexion’ of our elbows.\n\n

For a true handstand, the exercise is performed free-standing, held in the air, instead of doing it on a vertical support like a wall. This move can be performed on any flat surface, Parallettes, parallel bars, straight bars and Rings.\n\n

This skill is the bodyweight equivalent of the ‘Overhead Press’. So, the muscles worked while performing this skill is the same as that of Overhead Press. However, it activates a lot more stabiliser muscles in our body to maintain balance while being in an ‘extremely UNSTABLE position’. This skill requires you to master the ‘handstand’, which is what makes it RARE and ADVANCED.\n

                <b>90° Handstand Push Up</b> or simply \'90° Push Up\', is an advanced version of the Standard HSPU where our body needs to be ‘completely HORIZONTAL’ in the ‘lowest part’ of the ‘eccentric phase’. This horizontal position is known as the ‘Bent Arm Planche’. From this horizontal position, we need to push back up to the ‘VERTICAL’ Handstand position which constitutes the ‘concentric phase’ of this movement.\n\n

This move is termed as ‘90°’ as our body makes a complete ‘right angle’ while going from a completely horizontal position at the bottom to a completely vertical position at the top. The ‘Standard HSPU’ can be considered as an approximately ‘30-40° HSPU’.\n\n

This movement requires a lot more strength and wrist mobility as compared to the Standard HSPU, making it a lot HARDER than the Standard version. Obviously, this skill does require mastery in ‘Handstand’, ‘Standard HSPU’ and ‘Bent Arm Planche’. So, make sure you have mastered them first.\n

            <div id="2">
                The <b>Shoulder Flag</b> is a STEP UP from the ‘Dragon Flag’ and a STEP DOWN from the ‘Human Flag’, in which you suspend yourself sideways between two outstretched arms. The best way to describe a Shoulder Flag is that you start by creating a vice grip between your hands, a vertical pole, and the upper traps. You are basically trying to make a pole sandwich between your upper trap and both hands.\n\n

Once the pole is positioned correctly between your neck and your shoulder, you hop your lower body above the ground, while pulling through your arms as strong as you can. From there, you extend your entire body from shoulders to the toes until they are horizontal to the ground.\n\n

This Skill requires significant strength in your shoulders, lats, arms and your Core. You also definitely need ‘significant grip strength’ to perform this, as the only part of your body in contact with the pole would be your ‘palms’ and your ‘upper traps’.\n\n

You obviously need to master the ‘Dragon Flag’ as this is the ‘completely horizontal’ version of it. The main difference between the ‘Dragon Flag’ and the ‘Shoulder Flag’ is that the former move can be performed involving ‘concentric’, ‘eccentric’ and ‘Isometric’ phases, whereas the latter move is a purely ‘Isometric’ Skill.\n

                The <b>Human Flag</b> aka ‘Side Lever’ is an Advanced Isometric Skill where the body is parallel to the ground supported by a vertical bar. A straight line is formed using the arms and body. The move requires the performer to have significant upper body Pushing, Pulling and Core strength.\n\n

This Skill is tougher than the ‘Shoulder Flag’ as the Shoulder Flag activates more of our ‘rectus abdominis’ muscles and it’s also performed using bent arms. On the other hand, the Human Flag activates more of our ‘external obliques’ (which are relatively weaker than ‘rectus abdominis’) and is also performed using ‘straight arms’, which undoubtedly makes this Skill tougher than the ‘Shoulder Flag’. So, PLEASE MASTER THE SHOULDER FLAG FIRST!!\n\n

This skill primarily involves keeping our ‘entire body horizontal’ to the ground by ‘pushing through the lower arm’ and ‘pulling through the upper arm’. So, you need to have a decent amount of ‘pushing’ and ‘pulling’ strength in order to start training this skill. You should be able to perform

            <div id="2">
                The <b>Back Lever</b> is an Advanced Isometric Skill where our entire body is held ‘hanging horizontal’ to the ground from a horizontal support. Our entire body acts as the ‘lever’ where our arms act as the ‘fulcrum’ of the lever. Our lower body acts as the ‘load’ and our upper body generates the necessary ‘effort’ needed to balance the lower body load in order to maintain the entire body horizontal to the ground.\n\n

This Skill can be performed on any horizontal support like a Pull Up bar, parallel Dip bars, straight bars and Rings. As this is a Hanging Skill, our body is naturally in ‘stable equilibrium’ while performing this. So, performing it on any horizontal support won’t alter the difficulty of this skill.\n\n

This skill is termed as ‘Back’ Lever because our ‘arms’ acting as the fulcrum remain ‘behind our back’ the entire time. The ‘entire anterior chain’ of our body faces ‘towards the ground’ while performing this skill.\n\n

This skill requires ‘significant upper body strength’ (especially your ‘back’ and ‘lats’), ‘shoulder and elbow mobility’ to perform it safely and correctly. So, you must be able to perform

Also in this Skill, your ‘scapula’ needs to be ‘Retracted’ instead of being ‘Protracted’ as in the case of L-sit and V-sit.\n\n
You obviously \'master the V-sit first\' in order to start training for this Skill.\n

                The <b>Hefesto</b> or \'German Hang Muscle Up\' is a Muscle Up that’s performed starting from a ‘Supinated German Hang’ and pulling ourselves up on the bar with our hands behind our back throughout this movement.\n\n

This is an Advanced strength Skill that requires ‘considerable shoulder mobility’, ‘bicep strength’, ‘forearm strength’ and a ‘very solid conditioning of the joints, tendons and ligaments of the elbows and shoulders’. This Skill is generally performed on Pull Up bars with a ‘False grip’.\n\n

You must be ‘very comfortable’ with the ‘Supinated German Hang’, ‘Supinated Korean Dips’, ‘Deep Pelican Push Ups’, ‘Chin ups’ and the ‘Supinated Back Lever’ before even thinking of attempting this Skill, as it’s EXTREMELY EASY for anyone to get ‘shoulder injuries’, ‘elbow tendinitis’ and ‘bicep tear’ through this INTENSE skill! Also make sure to properly WARM UP before training for this Skill.\n\n

•	‘AT LEAST 15 chin ups in a row’\n\n
•	‘Supinated Back Lever hold for AT LEAST 10 Seconds’\n\n\n

These prerequisite movements will condition your shoulder joints, elbow joints, tendons and ligaments, biceps and forearms properly in order to safely start training for the ‘Hefesto’. If you skip the basics, then you will most probably end up like the guy shown in the following pic.\n

This Skill is termed so because our body makes the shape of an ‘angel’ while performing it on the Pull Up bar with a ‘False grip’. This Skill involves 5 phases:-\n\n
                i)  Reversed grip hang\n\n
                ii) Reversed grip Pull Up\n\n
                iii) Shoulder spin (leading to elbows pointing inwards)\n\n

                The <b>Planche</b> is an Advanced Isometric Calisthenic or Gymnastic Skill that involves keeping our ‘entire body straight and horizontal’ to the ground in mid-air, supported on the ground using only our straight arms.\n\n

Our palms in contact with the ground are just below our hips, which is the mid-line of our body. This Skill is the Advanced version of the \'Bent Arm Planche\' where instead of our arms being ‘bent’, they are kept ‘STRAIGHT’ the entire time. This Skill is nothing but a ‘vertical mirror image’ of the ‘Front Lever’, but it’s still way more physically demanding that the Front Lever. Due to the extreme difficulty of this movement, even the ‘Straddle’ version of this Skill is considered as a good ‘Planche’.\n\n

This Skill can be performed on any flat surface, Parallettes, parallel bars, straight bars, Pull Up bars and Rings (most difficult). This Skill can be performed using ‘Pronated’, ‘Neutral’ and ‘Supinated’ wrist positions. When it comes to ‘BALANCING’, the difficulty increases from ‘pronated’ to ‘supinated’ wrist position. But as far as ‘STRESS ON THE WRIST’ is concerned, the difficulty decreases from ‘pronated’ to ‘supinated’ position.\n

\n\nThis Skill is essentially a \'Pushing Skill\' rather than a Pulling or Hanging Skill like the front and Back Lever. So, being a ‘Pushing’ movement, this Skill obviously involves the activation of stabiliser muscles to maintain our balance at the top position due to ‘UNSTABLE equilibrium’.\n\n

This Skill is considered to be amongst the \'MOST CHALLENGING\' Calisthenic Skills in existence. This Skill requires INCREDIBLE overall upper body Pushing strength, shoulder strength, wrist mobility, arm strength and Core strength apart from the strength required for balancing. This move also requires a solid overall conditioning of your shoulder joints and elbow tendons. So, you must obviously MASTER THE BASICS before diving into Planche training.\n\n

            <div id="2">
                An <b>Inverted Cross</b> is an Advanced Gymnastic Isometric Skill performed on the Rings in an ‘Inverted Handstand position’, with the arms stretched straight out from the shoulders perpendicular to the body. Essentially it is an ‘upside-down Iron Cross’.\n\n
This Skill too requires extreme levels of Core strength, balance, coordination, shoulder strength, straight arm strength, and obviously strong conditioning of the shoulder and elbow joints.\n

\n\nThis Skill requires a hell lot more balance when compared to an Iron Cross, as you are in a ‘Handstand position’ and that too on the ‘UNSTABLE Rings’, which adds to its difficulty. So, an obvious PREREQUISITE to start training for this Skill would be to master the ‘Ring Handstand’. The other prerequisites are similar to that of an ‘Iron Cross’. It would also be safer to practise the Inverted Cross on the ground first, and then on the Rings.\n\n

                Well, that\'s the speciality of \'Mechanical\' Engineers. They\'re multi-talented xD! All jokes aside, this ISN\'T a very complex app. So, developing this one would be a \'cakewalk\' for \'Experienced\' App Developers. But as I had NO prior app development experience, this was a bit challenging for me. Despite being in the \'Mechanical\' branch, my inclination towards \'CODING\' increased a lot since my

From then onwards, I consistently worked on my weaknesses for \'3 years\' and ended up getting to a decent level of strength and fitness (13 Pull Ups in a row, 30 Push Ups in a row, 20 Dips in a row etc.). It was challenging in the beginning, but slowly as I got stronger, I started developing a passion for FITNESS and \'CALISTHENICS\' (aka bodyweight training). I\'ve NEITHER hired a \'PERSONAL FITNESS TRAINER\' (as I couldn\'t afford one), NOR have I ever used any \'FITNESS APPS\' (as almost all Fitness apps out there are totally USELESS) throughout my fitness journey. Eventually, because of that, I ended up making a hell lot of avoidable mistakes which was a complete waste of time and energy.\n\n

            <div id="1">
A bruised heel is an injury to the fat pad that protects the heel bone. It\'s also known as policeman\'s heel. You can get a bruised heel from the repeated force of your foot striking the ground, like if you run or jump a lot. It can also happen from a single injury, such as jumping from a big height onto your heel. It most commonly occurs while using skateboards.\n\n
