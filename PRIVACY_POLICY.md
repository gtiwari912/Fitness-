## Fitness Guide for Beginners: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Fitness Guide App for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Abhishek Sawant. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. This app does not involve any sort of authentication or login. This app is purely meant for spreading awareness regarding fitness through text, images, linked articles and videos. That's it. There's absolutely no need for you to enter any sort of personal info to access its content.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Abhishek Sawant.
